# Terminal tab title should reflect currently running agent

The worker currently sets the terminal tab title to the branch name. It should instead reflect the currently running agent (e.g. dispatch, plan, implement, land) so you can see at a glance what each worker is doing.

Also find something shorter than the current "coven: " prefix — it takes up too much space in narrow tab bars.
