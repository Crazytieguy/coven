# Make review backlog cap explicit in dispatch agent

The dispatch agent (`.coven/agents/dispatch.md`) says "If `review/` has several items, prefer implementing or sleeping over creating more plans." Too vague — change to an explicit soft cap of 10 items (still plan P0 issues even when over the cap).
