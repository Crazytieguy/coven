# Brief

self_transition_review: I think the review agent should also read the original issue off the board, and make another judgement call on whether to land the change or post questions instead. If the main agent made decisions without asking: discard the work and post questions on the board instead. We also probably want the review agent to evaluate the implementation for quality and improve anything they notice can be improved. Otherwise good to proceed!
