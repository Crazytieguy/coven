# Brief

wait-for-user: We can make it even shorter but still clearer. I think "a permission was dnied" isn't exactly the right trigger: many permission denials are fine. But "permission to run a critical workflow command" should trigger wait for human. Hitting an error you can't resolve: some errors should block and some shouldn't. Basically the examples should be things that block **all** work, not just the work the agent is currently doing. Please propose another final version with this principle in mind. And no need to have the sleep: true note, we should be explaining the utility of sleep: true separately.
