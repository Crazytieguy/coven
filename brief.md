# Brief

The recent system.md change for post-compaction context loss was a tiny bit too aggressive: system.md should only include context that's useful to all agents (such as the land.sh script and general workflow)
The dispatch agent should copy useful context from the brief more faithfully, and often copy the content verbatim
