# Brief

wait-for-user: Good to go!

New issue: I think after exiting an embeded interactive session it would be nice to just have one status line. So instead of:
```
[returned to coven]


[interrupted — Ctrl+O to open interactive]
```
It could just be:
```
[returned to coven — Ctrl+O to re-open interactive]
```
