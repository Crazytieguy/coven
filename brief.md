# Brief

wait-for-user: I'm not super happy with the prompts, I think they're a bit too aggressive and at the same time I think "ambiguous requirements" is a bad reason to wait for user: good workflows will have a built in way to asynchronously ask the user questions. Needs to be re-proposed. Also I don't see a reason the worker and ralph shouldn't just share this prompt (and code?). agents skip board posts: no action needed right now, I have separate plans for improving the main agent
