# Brief

The main agent should lean a bit more towards questions, even if they're small. For instance when several approaches are viable. I want to see if we can overshoot in that direction (but don't be aggressive)
I think I actually do want a "Done" section in the board, with a single line per completed task. Only cleaned up via explicit request from brief.md
Please give me a short overview (via the board) of the current behavior for transition parsing failure, including retries, and propose a couple small possible changes (retry iterations etc)
