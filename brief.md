# Brief

self transition: I want to see if we can get the model to transition to review by giving it just a **slightly** less trivial task (maybe implementing a slightly tricky algorithm: still fast for vcr because it's a single file generation). If the approach fails update me and we can decide if to go even harder or change the prompt
