# Brief

Add tasks here — one per line or section. Workers pick them up automatically.

When workers have questions, they'll appear on `board.md` above the divider.
Write your answers here (just reference the issue by name) and commit.

You can also add general directives ("prefer X over Y", "don't touch module Z").
Workers read this file but never edit it.
