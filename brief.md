# Brief

dispatch.md: I'm noticing I also don't love "Use your judgement on where to move the issue: if it still needs exploration or has unresolved design questions, move it to `# Plan`. If the path forward is clear, move it to `# Ready`.". It should mostly defer to the human rather than deciding. Can simplify
review "improve and land" section: can be shorter. Maybe just:
```
**Improve and land** if the approach is sound:
- Fix quality issues
- Simplify, dry
- Clean up redundant, or inconsistent comments
- Check against project guidelines
- Commit
```
Also I feel like maybe some decisions for this issue were lost along the way. Look at the board.md and brief.md history to get full context.
Good go go!

The "Strengthen dispatch prompt" issue can be dropped - subsumed by the agent prompt revisions
