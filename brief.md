# Brief

Issue: when in :N pager, some keystrokes are captured by coven instead of the pager. We had the same exact issue with the Ctrl+O interactive sessions, so probably the same solution should work. That said I've also noticed that my first keystroke when entering Ctrl+O interactive mode tends to not send. This could just be a claude code thing (hasn't fully loaded yet), but worth a check
