# Brief

Bell sound: really I ideally want a system notification rather than a sound, if that's possible (it would also tell me the title of the terminal tab that needs my attention). But easier fix: I think `coven worker` and `coven ralph` should not play a bell every time Claude finishes a turn. Really it should just be when specifically waiting for user input: the only mode that does this at the end of a turn is `run`. Even going idle doesn't need a bell/notification
