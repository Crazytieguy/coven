self_transition_review: I think we probably want to improve the prompt, but I've found that explaining the "why" often works better than ALL CAPS instructions. The "why" for this is that a review with a fresh context window often catches issues that could be missed if reviewed in the same context window as implementation. It's like fresh eyes. Though: if haiku performs the task correctly easily on the first try maybe that means it really isn't hard enough to warant independent review. But we want a safety buffer. Let's maybe also make the task just slightly harder. Please propose several prompting options
