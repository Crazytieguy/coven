# Brief

dispatch.md change: just tell it to preserve **Decisions** and human input verbatim, no need to complicate it. Please re-draft
"Your job is exploration, not implementation" is still not accurate. Please redraft: the goal is to identify important decisions, ambiguities, tradeoffs, inconsistencies, and surface them for review. Questions can also be expanded a bit.  Can also remove the "if the path forward is straightforward" thing, that was just a measure for reducing the likelihood the old main agent proceeds to implementation
Implement agent: it doesn't transition to dispatch and so it never needs to land, and it also doesn't need to delete scratch.md. These are for the review agent. Simplify even further.
review: I like refer back. "The implementer made" not needed: make it about the changes, not the implementer. "Fix any quality issues": let's make it a bit more about quality. Mention dry, redundant or inconsistent comments. And also generically maybe "project guidelines", so it adapts to the CLAUDE.md guidelines. Otherwise good
Plan agent "even when obvious" - I'd reframe to "only one viable option" if the decision is important (so it doesn't document trivial decisions)
