# Brief

I want a more detailed drafting of the agent changes before I approve the plan. VCR re-recording: no it is part of this task, but can wait till the end of implementation (just don't block on getting them to pass before implementing). I think "request changes" isn't right, because the changes are discarded. It's not sending it back to implementation, it's sending it back to the human. Please propose at least 5 alternatives. Plan.md: it should document important decisions even if it doesn't notice more than one viable option (these aren't questions, but the human can decide to push back on them and it sets expectations for implementation). Prompts are sensitive: please propose changes in more detail so I can evaluate
