# Brief

wait for user: we definitely want to include it in the built in coven worker system prompt, not .coven/system.md (this is intended as a template). I think it should be presented as a last resort, because it completely blocks the worker until a human is available. Probably should be same for ralph tbh. Next step: I want a quick overview of the prompting for this and some options. <break> sounds fine
