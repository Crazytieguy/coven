# Brief

Post compaction context loss: can maybe extract shared things and put them in system.md (like landing), but don't be too aggressive with it
Transition parsing failure: Both proposals sound great. Implementing this should block on having the wait-for-user tag functional so that it can also be integrated. That could actually let us bump the retries to 3: the agent should explicitly output the wait for user tag
