Issue: [P2] README overhaul: add usage guidelines, document worker/fork/agents/init/status/gc commands, update features list, add a commands section. Currently only covers basic features.
Status: draft

## Approach

Restructure README.md to comprehensively document all commands and features while keeping it scannable. The current README covers install, motivation, basic features, and testing. The overhaul adds full command documentation and usage guidance.

### Proposed structure

1. **Header + tagline** (keep existing)
2. **Install** (keep existing)
3. **Why?** (keep existing, minor wording updates)
4. **Quick Start** (new) — minimal examples to get running: basic prompt, follow-up, ralph loop
5. **Commands** (new) — one subsection per command:
   - `coven [PROMPT]` — interactive session (default). Cover streaming display, follow-up (Alt+Enter), mid-stream steering (Enter while running), message inspection (`:N`, `:ToolName`), Ctrl-C/Ctrl-D/Escape
   - `coven ralph [PROMPT]` — looping workflow. Cover `--iterations`, `--break-tag`, `--no-break`, filesystem persistence
   - `coven worker` — orchestration worker. Cover dispatch/agent/land cycle, worktrees, `--branch`, `--worktree-base`
   - `coven init` — project setup for orchestration. Cover what it creates (`.coven/agents/`, `issues/`, `review/`)
   - `coven status` — show active workers
   - `coven gc` — clean up orphaned worktrees
6. **Shared Flags** (new) — flags available on multiple commands:
   - `--show-thinking`
   - `--fork` (with brief explanation of fork tags)
   - `-- [args]` (passthrough to claude CLI)
7. **Orchestration** (new) — brief overview of the agent/issue/review workflow that `worker` + `init` enable. Link to `.coven/workflow.md` generated by `init` for full details.
8. **Testing** (keep existing)
9. **License** (keep existing)

### What to remove

- "Planned" section — these are internal roadmap items, not user-facing docs. Move to ideas.md or drop.

### Content guidelines

- Each command section: one-sentence description, usage line, flags table, 1-2 examples
- Keep total README under ~300 lines — enough to be comprehensive without being a wall of text
- Use `coven --help` output style for flag descriptions (terse)
- Don't document internal architecture (VCR, renderer, etc.) — that's contributor docs, not user docs

## Questions

### Should the orchestration section be detailed or just a teaser?

The worker/init/agents system is fairly complex. Options:
1. **Teaser + link**: Brief paragraph explaining the concept, link to the generated `.coven/workflow.md` for details. Keeps README focused.
2. **Full docs**: Document agents, issue states, dispatch flow, conflict resolution in README. Comprehensive but long.

I lean toward option 1 — the orchestration docs are already generated by `coven init` and live closer to where they're used.

Answer:

### Should we include a "Configuration" section?

The README currently doesn't document how to configure claude CLI defaults (permission mode, thinking tokens, etc.) via passthrough args. Options:
1. **Skip**: The `-- [args]` flag documentation is sufficient, users know claude CLI
2. **Brief section**: A few common recipes (e.g., `coven -- --permission-mode plan`, `coven -- --max-thinking-tokens 8000`)
