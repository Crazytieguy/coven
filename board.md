## P1: Main agent should be more willing to ask clarifying questions

The main agent should be even more willing to ask clarifying questions instead of implementing. Propose several approaches to prompt changes, including at least one where the question flow becomes more first-class.

## Done

- P1: Transition YAML parsing fails on colons in values
- P1: Refine post-compaction context: system.md scope and dispatch faithfulness
- P1: Transition parsing failure behavior
- P1: Add "Done" section to board
- P1: Add main agent self-transition review test
- P1: Re-record VCR tests and fix snapshots
- P1: Improve post-compaction context loss
