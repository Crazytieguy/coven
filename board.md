## P1: Investigate compaction handling

## P1: Dynamic terminal title for coven worker

Research approaches for letting `coven worker` set the terminal title dynamically based on the current agent/task. Think of a few approaches and document trade-offs. This is a design task — no implementation yet.

Test whether coven correctly handles auto-compaction during long sessions. Trigger compaction by having haiku repeatedly read files with output each time. Document the observed behavior and any issues found. Do not implement a fix.
