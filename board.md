## P1: Investigate compaction handling

Test whether coven correctly handles auto-compaction during long sessions. Trigger compaction by having haiku repeatedly read files with output each time. Document the observed behavior and any issues found. Do not implement a fix.

## P1: Audit documentation for coven worker consistency

Audit all documentation (README, CLAUDE.md, agent prompts, system.md, etc.) to ensure consistency with the current `coven worker` system.
