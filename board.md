## P1: Add wait-for-user tag

New `<wait-for-user>` tag for agents to signal they're blocked on user input (e.g. needing permission for a necessary command).

## P1: Propose improvements for post-compaction context loss

Model tried `git push` instead of `bash .coven/land.sh` after session compaction. Also confused about interactive/non-interactive transitions. Propose possible improvements.
