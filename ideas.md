- Configurable? session workflow. Idea for implementation workflow:
  - Claude receives an implementation plan, implements it as usual (no git commit or anything)
  - When claude finishes, if there are unstaged changes a review claude looks at them (has access to the plan)
  - The review agent can decide:
    - Everything is clean
    - Iteration needed
    - Implementation approach was wrong (proposes plan changes)
  - If everything is clean, main agent is forked into:
    - Commited (instructed to commit)
    - Tech debt recorder: adds tech debt issues as needed
- Actually, there's no reason the workflow can't be defined dynamically based on what's appropriate for the task. But that's advanced territory. Can achieve things like:
  - Extra validation steps for different phases
  - Implement multi-phase plans in separate context windows (though maybe that means it should have been smaller tasks to begin with)
  - More checkpoints for forking
- Ok there are lots of cool ideas, but the best design will ultimately be pretty simple
