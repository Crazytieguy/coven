- [P2] Durable conflict logging: conflict files and resolution outcomes are only rendered to the terminal. Consider logging them to a file for post-mortem analysis. (plan: plans/durable-conflict-logging.md)
- [P2] Create a features / intended behavior reference document so it's clear what each command mode supports (interaction modes, session lifecycle, rendering expectations). Makes it easier to verify whether code reflects intended behavior. (plan: plans/features-reference-doc.md)
- [P2] SessionConfig construction repeated across run.rs, ralph.rs, and worker.rs with similar field patterns. Consider a builder or factory method to reduce duplication. (plan: plans/sessionconfig-builder.md)
- [P1] The test cases folder is currently a flat list of files, and it's hard for me to navigate. I want to organize all tests into a neat folder structure (plan: plans/test-folder-structure.md)
- [P1] Regular terminal keyboard nativagion doesn't work when giving interactive input. It would be nice to be able to use the regular terminal keybindings for things like jumping back a word or deleting a word etc (plan: plans/readline-keybindings.md)
- [P1] :N view for common claude code tools should display in a nicer format than just the raw json (plan: plans/pretty-tool-view.md)
- [P2] Duplication between `process_claude_event` and `flush_event_buffer` in session_loop.rs: both have identical fork-detection, has_pending, handle_inbound, and result-handling logic. Extract a shared event-classification helper to reduce drift risk. (plan: plans/session-loop-event-dedup.md)
- [P1] :N view in pager is bottom-aligned for messages smaller than the height of the terminal. Should be top aligned by default
