- [P1] Fork: VCR support — `run_fork` spawns sessions directly (bypassing `vcr.call`), and fork detection is gated behind `vcr.is_live()`. Fork behavior is completely untested via VCR. Need to either record fork child sessions through VCR or find another way to test fork end-to-end. (plan: plans/fork-vcr-support.md)
- [P2] Fork: `flush_event_buffer` doesn't detect fork tags — if a Result event with a `<fork>` tag arrives while the user is typing (events are buffered), the fork will be silently skipped. Edge case but should be handled. (plan: plans/flush-buffer-fork-detection.md)
- [P2] Durable conflict logging: conflict files and resolution outcomes are only rendered to the terminal. Consider logging them to a file for post-mortem analysis. (plan: plans/durable-conflict-logging.md)
- [P2] Create a features / intended behavior reference document so it's clear what each command mode supports (interaction modes, session lifecycle, rendering expectations). Makes it easier to verify whether code reflects intended behavior. (plan: plans/features-reference-doc.md)
- [P2] README overhaul: add usage guidelines, document worker/fork/agents/init/status/gc commands, update features list, add a commands section. Currently only covers basic features. (plan: plans/readme-overhaul.md)
- [P2] Windows support: uses Unix-specific APIs (libc::tcflush, /dev/null, kill command, rsync). Need platform abstractions or #[cfg] guards to support x86_64-pc-windows-msvc target. (plan: plans/windows-support.md)
- [P2] Missing test coverage for `init`, `gc`, and `status` commands — these have no VCR test cases. All other commands have at least basic coverage. (plan: plans/test-coverage-init-gc-status.md)
