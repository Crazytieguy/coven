- The steering VCR test doesn't demonstrate steering working — it uses a task too short for the steering message to take effect. Re-record with a longer multi-step task so the snapshot shows Claude responding to the steering input. (plan: plans/steering-vcr-test-integrity.md)
- Theme colors may need further tuning for specific terminal themes (DarkGrey replaced with Attribute::Dim but worth verifying on light backgrounds too) (plan: plans/theme-color-tuning.md)
- When there are queued messages, we should display them somehow below the messages that are streaming in. Different display for follow up and steering messages. Not sure what the right technical approach is here. (plan: plans/queued-message-display.md)
- In ralph mode, the raw `<break>reason</break>` XML tag appears in Claude's streamed text output. The break reason is then also displayed cleanly as "Loop complete: reason" after the stats line. The raw XML should be stripped from the rendered text to avoid duplication and ugly output. (plan: plans/strip-break-tag-from-output.md)
- We should use the terminal width to truncate rendering more accurately (plan: plans/terminal-width-truncation.md)
- Some responses have extra blank lines at the top before the first content. Claude sometimes emits an initial text block containing only `\n\n` before a thinking block (visible in error_handling, mcp_tool, grep_glob VCR recordings but not simple_qa or multi_tool). The renderer streams these faithfully, creating inconsistent vertical whitespace. Should strip leading-whitespace-only text blocks or suppress blank text that precedes thinking. (plan: plans/leading-blank-lines.md)
- Since we're now committing plans and issues immediately, claude can find reviewed plan just using git (I don't commit plans when I review them) (plan: plans/git-based-plan-review-discovery.md)
