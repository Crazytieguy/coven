- The steering VCR test doesn't demonstrate steering working — it uses a task too short for the steering message to take effect. Re-record with a longer multi-step task so the snapshot shows Claude responding to the steering input. (plan: plans/steering-vcr-test-integrity.md)
- Theme colors may need further tuning for specific terminal themes (DarkGrey replaced with Attribute::Dim but worth verifying on light backgrounds too) (plan: plans/theme-color-tuning.md)
- When there are queued messages, we should display them somehow below the messages that are streaming in. Different display for follow up and steering messages. Not sure what the right technical approach is here. (plan: plans/queued-message-display.md)
- We should use the terminal width to truncate rendering more accurately (plan: plans/terminal-width-truncation.md)
