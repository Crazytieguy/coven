- [P2] Big issue: support model-driven context forking via claude cli's `--fork-session` flag. Model outputs xml with definitions for some number of sub tasks (just an assistant message), coven parses it to find the sub tasks and creates a forked claude session per sub task using `--fork-session` with a simple follow up message like "you own subtask N" (each child gets the full parent context window — that's the value over native subagents), waits for all subtasks to complete, and then continues the original session, displaying to the model the final assistant message for each subtask. (plan: plans/context-forking.md)
- [P2] Durable conflict logging: conflict files and resolution outcomes are only rendered to the terminal. Consider logging them to a file for post-mortem analysis. (plan: plans/durable-conflict-logging.md)
- [P2] Create a features / intended behavior reference document so it's clear what each command mode supports (interaction modes, session lifecycle, rendering expectations). Makes it easier to verify whether code reflects intended behavior. (plan: plans/features-reference-doc.md)
- [P0] `runner.kill()` uses SIGKILL which doesn't give Claude time to persist the conversation. Resume after Ctrl+C fails with "No conversation found with session ID". Consider using SIGTERM or closing stdin instead. (plan: plans/graceful-ctrl-c.md)
- [P1] VCR test snapshots show title escape sequence leakage: OSC title sequences partially render as visible text (e.g., "oven:" instead of invisible title, "emoving worktree" instead of "Removing worktree"). The test output capture doesn't fully strip OSC sequences. (plan: plans/osc-title-leakage.md)
- [P1] Consider removing the explicit "mode" system for test case toml files. Instead, just support key combinations generically, ideally using a library. Plan file should either include an implementation plan or a convincing reason not to do this. (plan: plans/remove-mode-system.md)
