- Probably want a way to interrupt a session before prompting (requires restarting it with --resume, same as if the session ends organically) (blocked on questions/session-interrupt.md)
- The steering VCR test passes despite steering being broken — it only validates that stdin was written, not that Claude responded to the message. The test should verify that Claude's output actually changed in response to steering input. (Related to steering redesign — may be moot once steering is fixed, but worth noting for test integrity)
- Confirmed: `claude -p --input-format stream-json` ignores stdin messages sent mid-stream. The steering VCR test proves this — the steering message "Actually, just count the lines instead" was sent after tool 1, but Claude's thinking says "Simple file. Let me summarize it." and responds with a summary (original task), not a line count. Follow-up messages sent after a result DO work (multi_turn test). Steering needs to be redesigned — likely by interrupting the session and resuming with the steering message as a follow-up. (blocked on questions/steering-redesign.md)
- When entering prompt mode there should be some indication, and also it should always happen on a new line (i.e. if there's a tool call or assistant message in progress). When the prompt is sent the text should be cleared so that buffered text can be printed in the correct location, and the prompt text should be reprinted when its sent to claude via stdin (but only after the current streaming message completes, if there is one) (blocked on questions/prompt-mode-indication.md)
- Theme colors may need further tuning for specific terminal themes (DarkGrey replaced with Attribute::Dim but worth verifying on light backgrounds too)
- Meta issue: claude consistently checks for answered questions at the start of a session instead of the end. This means task.md should be clarified better
- When there are queued messages, we should display them somehow bellow the messages that are streaming in. Different display for follow up and steering messages. Not sure what the right technical approach is here. (blocked on questions/queued-messages-display.md)
