- If there's a queued follow up message, don't print the Done line and session separator, just the follow up. And when a follow up is submitted, also don't display the separator (---) (plan: plans/followup-display-cleanup.md)
- [P1] VCR test infrastructure: git repo initialization — when the VCR recorder creates a temp dir, also `git init` and create an initial commit so tests are realistic. Re-record all VCR fixtures afterward and update snapshots.
- [P1] Agent prompt file loading — new module for loading agent definitions from `.coven/agents/*.md`, parsing YAML frontmatter (description, required arguments), providing a registry of available agent types. No behavioral integration yet.
- [P1] Git worktree primitives — new module wrapping git worktree operations: spawn (random branch, `git worktree add -b`, rsync gitignored files) and land (rebase, conflict detection, ff-merge, branch cleanup). Tested with real git in temp repos. See `design/spawn-worktree-example` and `design/land-worktree-example` for inspiration.
- [P1] Decompose next orchestration issues — meta-issue: once the above three are complete, create the next batch of issues (worker subcommand, landing integration, dispatch, etc.)
- [P2] review all snapshots for correctness and UI quality (plan: plans/snapshot-review.md)
- [P2] Concurrent subagent rendering: support displaying multiple concurrent claude Task subagents running in parallel. Exact rendering approach needs to be discussed (plan: plans/concurrent-subagent-rendering.md)
- [P2] Big issue: support model-driven context forking via claude cli's `--fork` flag. Model outputs xml with definitions for some number of sub tasks (just an assistant message), coven parses it to find the sub tasks and creates a forked claude session per sub task using `--fork` with a simple follow up message like "you own subtask N" (each child gets the full parent context window — that's the value over native subagents), waits for all subtasks to complete, and then continues the original session, displaying to the model the final assistant message for each subtask. Blocked on: concurrent subagent rendering.
