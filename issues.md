- [P1] Orchestration next steps: core loop, templates, dispatch serialization, worker state, permission mode, conflict resolution, gc, and workflow documentation all implemented. Remaining: CLAUDE.md integration (open design question), end-to-end testing.
- [P0] VCR + snapshot testing for concurrent worker sessions. Needs design — recording multiple interleaved sessions, snapshot format for parallel output, and how to make tests deterministic. (plan: plans/concurrent-worker-testing.md)
- [P1] Brainstorm alternatives to "approved" for plan status naming. "Approved" is awkward — consider: ready, accepted, go, etc. (plan: plans/plan-status-naming.md)
- [P1] Add snapshot testing for the :N output (plan: plans/snapshot-view-message.md)
- [P2] Test system gap: follow-up and steering messages aren't visible in snapshots because the test harness sends messages but doesn't simulate how they'd appear in the terminal. Investigate whether the test runner should inject display lines for sent messages. (plan: plans/test-message-display.md)
- [P2] Big issue: support model-driven context forking via claude cli's `--fork` flag. Model outputs xml with definitions for some number of sub tasks (just an assistant message), coven parses it to find the sub tasks and creates a forked claude session per sub task using `--fork` with a simple follow up message like "you own subtask N" (each child gets the full parent context window — that's the value over native subagents), waits for all subtasks to complete, and then continues the original session, displaying to the model the final assistant message for each subtask.
- [P2] Durable conflict logging: conflict files and resolution outcomes are only rendered to the terminal. Consider logging them to a file for post-mortem analysis.
