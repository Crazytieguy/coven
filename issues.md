- If there's a queued follow up message, don't print the Done line and session separator, just the follow up. And when a follow up is submitted, also don't display the separator (---) (plan: plans/followup-display-cleanup.md)
- [P1] Agent prompt file loading — new module for loading agent definitions from `.coven/agents/*.md`, parsing YAML frontmatter (description, required arguments), providing a registry of available agent types. No behavioral integration yet. (plan: plans/agent-prompt-file-loading.md)
- [P1] Git worktree primitives — new module wrapping git worktree operations: spawn (random branch, `git worktree add -b`, rsync gitignored files) and land (rebase, conflict detection, ff-merge, branch cleanup). Tested with real git in temp repos. See `design/spawn-worktree-example` and `design/land-worktree-example` for inspiration. (plan: plans/git-worktree-primitives.md)
- [P1] Decompose next orchestration issues — meta-issue: once the above three are complete, create the next batch of issues (worker subcommand, landing integration, dispatch, etc.)
- [P2] Test system gap: follow-up and steering messages aren't visible in snapshots because the test harness sends messages but doesn't simulate how they'd appear in the terminal. Investigate whether the test runner should inject display lines for sent messages. (plan: plans/test-message-display.md)
- [P2] Concurrent subagent rendering: support displaying multiple concurrent claude Task subagents running in parallel. Exact rendering approach needs to be discussed (plan: plans/concurrent-subagent-rendering.md)
- [P2] Big issue: support model-driven context forking via claude cli's `--fork` flag. Model outputs xml with definitions for some number of sub tasks (just an assistant message), coven parses it to find the sub tasks and creates a forked claude session per sub task using `--fork` with a simple follow up message like "you own subtask N" (each child gets the full parent context window — that's the value over native subagents), waits for all subtasks to complete, and then continues the original session, displaying to the model the final assistant message for each subtask. Blocked on: concurrent subagent rendering.
