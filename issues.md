- [P2] Fork: `flush_event_buffer` doesn't detect fork tags — if a Result event with a `<fork>` tag arrives while the user is typing (events are buffered), the fork will be silently skipped. Edge case but should be handled. (plan: plans/flush-buffer-fork-detection.md)
- [P2] Durable conflict logging: conflict files and resolution outcomes are only rendered to the terminal. Consider logging them to a file for post-mortem analysis. (plan: plans/durable-conflict-logging.md)
- [P2] Create a features / intended behavior reference document so it's clear what each command mode supports (interaction modes, session lifecycle, rendering expectations). Makes it easier to verify whether code reflects intended behavior. (plan: plans/features-reference-doc.md)
- [P2] README overhaul: add usage guidelines, document worker/fork/agents/init/status/gc commands, update features list, add a commands section. Currently only covers basic features. (plan: plans/readme-overhaul.md)
- [P0] I want to step up the workflow command testing: have a test with `coven init` + multiple `coven workflow` running concurrently, test a real situation
