- If there's a queued follow up message, don't print the Done line and session separator, just the follow up. And when a follow up is submitted, also don't display the separator (---) (plan: plans/followup-display-cleanup.md)
- [P1] Orchestration next steps: core loop, templates, dispatch serialization, worker state, permission mode, conflict resolution, gc, and workflow documentation all implemented. Remaining: CLAUDE.md integration (open design question), end-to-end testing.
- [P0] VCR + snapshot testing for concurrent worker sessions. Needs design — recording multiple interleaved sessions, snapshot format for parallel output, and how to make tests deterministic. (plan: plans/concurrent-worker-testing.md)
- [P1] "Landed" message prints even when agent committed nothing. Agent should always commit something unless it's a dispatch agent. If a non-dispatch agent produces no commits, consider resuming the session to ask it to commit. (plan: plans/landed-message-no-commits.md)
- [P1] Brainstorm alternatives to "approved" for plan status naming. "Approved" is awkward — consider: ready, accepted, go, etc.
- [P1] `coven init` should ask the user if they'd like to update CLAUDE.md to reference the workflow.
- [P1] Audit conflict resolution logic (worker.rs land_or_resolve). Complex nested loop with session resume, rebase retry, and multiple fallback paths — worth a careful review.
- [P2] Test system gap: follow-up and steering messages aren't visible in snapshots because the test harness sends messages but doesn't simulate how they'd appear in the terminal. Investigate whether the test runner should inject display lines for sent messages. (plan: plans/test-message-display.md)
- [P2] Concurrent subagent rendering: support displaying multiple concurrent claude Task subagents running in parallel. Exact rendering approach needs to be discussed (plan: plans/concurrent-subagent-rendering.md)
- [P2] Big issue: support model-driven context forking via claude cli's `--fork` flag. Model outputs xml with definitions for some number of sub tasks (just an assistant message), coven parses it to find the sub tasks and creates a forked claude session per sub task using `--fork` with a simple follow up message like "you own subtask N" (each child gets the full parent context window — that's the value over native subagents), waits for all subtasks to complete, and then continues the original session, displaying to the model the final assistant message for each subtask. Blocked on: concurrent subagent rendering.
