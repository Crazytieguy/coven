- Probably want a way to interrupt a session before prompting (requires restarting it with --resume, same as if the session ends organically)
- I'm unclear on the treatment of thinking: am I seeing streaming thinking, or is thinking not shown? Neither is what I wanted, I just want to see a collapsed thinking indicator (user can display the same way they'd display a tool call). That said, if thinking is currently displayed then I'm really enjoying reading it (out of curiosity), so we should have a cli flag to show all thinking (blocked on questions/thinking-display.md)
- (unclear if real issue): the VCR replay should fail the test if input isn't being sent correctly to claude
- It seems that our original research on claude -p mid-session stdin might have been wrong: it doesn't seem to actually send the message to the model. This needs to be checked, and if it's not possible to send messages to claude -p mid session we need to re-design the steering approach to interrupt the session and then resume it. We need to be careful not to kill while a tool is executing though, we should probably interrupt right as an assistant message starts. (All of this is just if claude -p in fact ignores stdin mid session). Another hypothesis is that I was using ralph mode before steering messages were functional in ralph mode
- Parallel tool calls: only the last call displays a checkmark. Not sure what to do about this (blocked on questions/parallel-tool-checkmarks.md)
- When entering prompt mode there should be some indication, and also it should always happen on a new line (i.e. if there's a tool call or assistant message in progress). When the prompt is sent the text should be cleared so that buffered text can be printed in the correct location, and the prompt text should be reprinted when its sent to claude via stdin (but only after the current streaming message completes, if there is one)
- :N for a tool should also show the result if available
- After :N exits, the input should be cleared and everything should continue as normal. Currently seems to just get stuck in buffering mode
- Theme colors may need further tuning for specific terminal themes (DarkGrey replaced with Attribute::Dim but worth verifying on light backgrounds too)
- Should display the session id every time a new claude session starts, so that it can be easily resumed by the user if needed (may already work — was invisible due to DarkGrey color)
