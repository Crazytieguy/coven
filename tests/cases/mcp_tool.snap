I've successfully fetched the Tokio documentation from https://docs.rs/tokio. The content has been saved locally and includes:

**Main sections:**
- A Tour of Tokio
- Authoring libraries
- Working with Tasks
- CPU-bound tasks and blocking code
- Asynchronous IO
- Examples
- Feature flags
- Unstable features
- Supported platforms
- WASM support

The documentation is now available at: `/private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-mcp_tool/.llms-fetch-mcp/docs.rs/tokio/index`

Let me know if you'd like me to explore specific sections or help you with any Tokio-related questions!
