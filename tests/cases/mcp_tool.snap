I've fetched the tokio documentation from https://docs.rs/tokio. It's been saved locally and converted to markdown.

The documentation includes sections on:
- **A Tour of Tokio** - Introduction and examples
- **Authoring libraries** - How to build libraries with Tokio
- **Working With Tasks** - Task spawning and management
- **CPU-bound tasks and blocking code** - Handling blocking operations
- **Asynchronous IO** - Async I/O patterns
- **Examples** - Code examples
- **Feature flags** - Available feature configurations
- **Unstable features** - Experimental APIs
- **Supported platforms** - Platform compatibility
- **WASM support** - WebAssembly support details

The documentation is cached locally at: `/private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-mcp_tool/.llms-fetch-mcp/docs.rs/tokio/index`

What would you like to know about Tokio?
