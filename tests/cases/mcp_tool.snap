I've successfully fetched the tokio documentation from https://docs.rs/tokio. The documentation is now cached locally with 363 lines covering:

- **A Tour of Tokio** - Introduction and examples
- **Authoring libraries** - How to create libraries with tokio
- **Working With Tasks** - Task management and spawning
- **CPU-bound tasks and blocking code** - Handling blocking operations
- **Asynchronous IO** - Async I/O patterns
- **Examples** - Code examples
- **Feature flags** - Available Cargo features
- **Platform support** - Including WASM support

You can now reference the documentation for specific information. Would you like me to fetch any specific section or help with something specific related to tokio?
