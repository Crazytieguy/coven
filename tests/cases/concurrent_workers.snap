I'll start by checking what issues are available in the system.

[2] ▶ Glob  issues/*.md
[3] ▶ Glob  review/*.md
[4] Thinking...
Now let me check the state and priority of each issue:

[5] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...

## Summary

I found 2 issues in the system, both approved and P1 priority:
1. **add-contributing.md** (approved, P1) — Create CONTRIBUTING.md file
2. **fix-typo.md** (approved, P1) — Fix "Helo" → "Hello" in README

No issues are in the planning queue (`new`, `changes-requested`, or `needs-replan`) and nothing is waiting for human review.

Since both issues are approved and ready to implement, I'll dispatch the simpler one first (fix-typo) to make quick progress.

I'll implement the plan from the issue file. Let me start by reading it.

Now I'll delete the issue file and commit the changes.

[17] ▶ Bash  git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[18] Thinking...
Done! I've successfully completed the implementation:

1. ✓ Fixed the typo in README.md: changed "Helo" to "Hello"
2. ✓ Deleted the issue file
3. ✓ Committed the changes with a descriptive message

The commit `14092f6` is now on the branch with the corrected text.

I'll check the issues and review directories to see what work is available.

**Analysis:**

The only issue available is `issues/add-contributing.md`, which is in the `approved` state (ready for implementation at P1 priority). However, `steady-drift-71` is currently running the implement agent on this exact issue.

Since another worker is already assigned to the only actionable work, I should not duplicate the effort.

I'll check the available issues and their states to decide what work to assign next.

**Analysis:**

- `issues/fix-typo.md`: state=`approved`, priority=`P1` — Currently being implemented by nimble-brook-17
- `issues/add-contributing.md`: state=`approved`, priority=`P1` — Ready to implement, not assigned yet
- `review/`: empty (no plans awaiting review)

Since there are no new issues to plan and the only unassigned work is the approved `add-contributing.md` issue, I'll route it to the implement agent.

The repository has no active issues. The `issues/` directory doesn't exist, and the `review/` directory is empty (only contains a `.gitkeep` file). There's no actionable work available.
