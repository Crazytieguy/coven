**Reasoning:**

I found two approved issues, both at P1 priority:
1. `fix-typo.md` — Fix README typo (simple, straightforward)
2. `add-contributing.md` — Create CONTRIBUTING.md file

Both are in `approved` state and ready to implement. Following the workflow preference to implement over plan, and starting with the simpler task first, I'll route the typo fix to the implement agent.

**Reasoning:**

I found one issue:
- `issues/add-contributing.md` — `priority: P1`, `state: approved`

Since this issue has an approved plan, it's ready for implementation. There are no issues in review awaiting human feedback, so the highest-value work is to implement this approved task.

## Implementation Complete ✅

I've successfully implemented the plan for the "Create CONTRIBUTING.md" issue:

1. **Created CONTRIBUTING.md** - Added a comprehensive contribution guide with sections for:
   - Getting Started (fork, clone, create branch)
   - Making Changes (guidelines for focus, commits, and style)
   - Submitting Changes (PR workflow)
   - Questions (support section)

2. **Deleted the issue file** - Removed `issues/add-contributing.md`

3. **Committed changes** - Created two commits:
   - `bfd9ab9` - Add CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
   - `1b39570` - Remove completed issue: add-contributing

The working tree is now clean and the implementation is complete!
