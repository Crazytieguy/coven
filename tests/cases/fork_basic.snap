Perfect! Both subtasks completed successfully. Let me verify the files were created:

[8] ▶ Bash  ls -la *.txt && echo "---" && cat hello.txt && echo "---" && cat ...

Excellent! Both files were created successfully:

- **hello.txt** contains: `hello world`
- **goodbye.txt** contains: `goodbye world`

The fork feature worked perfectly for delegating these two independent subtasks concurrently.
