[1] Thinking...
I'll create both files in parallel using fork:

<fork>
- Create hello.txt with 'hello'
- Create world.txt with 'world'
</fork>

[2] ⑂ Fork  Create hello.txt with 'hello' · Create world.txt with 'world'
  [2/1] ⑂ Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w00...
  [2/2] ⑂ Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w00...
  ⑂ Create hello.txt with 'hello' done
  ⑂ Create world.txt with 'world' done
[3] Thinking...
Done! Both files have been created in parallel:
- **hello.txt** with the text 'hello'
- **world.txt** with the text 'world'
