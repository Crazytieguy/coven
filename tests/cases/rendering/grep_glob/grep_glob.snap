[2] ▶ Grep  fn main
[3] Thinking...
There are no Rust files containing 'fn main' in this repository. Let me check if there are any Rust files at all:

[4] ▶ Glob  **/*.rs
[5] Thinking...
Found 2 Rust files in the repository. Let me check their contents:

[6] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...
[7] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...
[8] Thinking...
**Rust files containing 'fn main':**

1. **`src/main.rs`** - Contains the `fn main()` function with a "Hello, world!" print statement

The other Rust file (`src/lib.rs`) only contains a helper function `add()` and doesn't have a main function.
