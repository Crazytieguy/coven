[3] Thinking...
No Rust files containing 'fn main' were found in the current directory. Let me check what files are available:

[4] ▶ Glob  **/*.rs
[5] Thinking...
Found 2 Rust files. Let me search for 'fn main' with content:

[6] ▶ Grep  fn main
[7] Thinking...
Let me check the contents of these files to see what's in them:

[8] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...
[9] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...
[10] Thinking...
**Result:** There is **1 Rust file** containing `fn main`:

- `src/main.rs` (contains `fn main()` at line 1)

The other Rust file found (`src/lib.rs`) does not contain a `fn main` function—it only has a library function `add`.
