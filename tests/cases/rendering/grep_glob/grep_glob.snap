There are no Rust files containing `fn main` in the current directory. Let me check if there are any Rust files at all:

[4] ▶ Glob  **/*.rs

[8] Thinking...
Found **1 Rust file** containing `fn main`:

- `src/main.rs` - Contains the main function with a "Hello, world!" println statement

The other Rust file (`src/lib.rs`) contains only a utility function `add()` and does not have a main function.
