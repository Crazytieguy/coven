:Thinking  [1] Thinking

The user is asking me to list files in the current directory. I should use the Bash tool to do this with the `ls` command, since they're asking for a terminal operation to list files. Actually, wait - let me reconsider. The instructions say "Do NOT use the Bash to run commands when a relevant dedicated tool is provided." 

However, for listing files/directories, the Glob tool is for finding files by pattern matching, and Read is for reading file contents. Neither of those is really the right tool for just listing the contents of a directory. Bash with `ls` is the appropriate tool for this terminal operation.

Let me list the files in the current directory which is `/private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-tool_use`.
