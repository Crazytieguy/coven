:Thinking  [1] Thinking

The user is asking me to list files in the current directory. The primary working directory is `/private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-tool_use`.

I should use the Bash tool to list the files in the current directory using `ls` command, or I could use the Glob tool. Let me think about which is more appropriate.

Actually, the user is asking for a simple directory listing. I can use `ls` via Bash to show the files. Let me do that.
