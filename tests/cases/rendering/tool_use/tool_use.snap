Session 23d41da1-475c-4381-87cf-906972cf7a65 (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)

[3] Thinking...
The current directory is mostly empty, containing only:
- `.claude/` - local Claude configuration directory
- `.git/` - git repository

This is a fresh git repository with minimal content. Would you like me to explore what's in the `.claude` directory, or is there something specific you'd like to do?
