I've successfully fetched the tokio documentation from https://docs.rs/tokio. The content has been saved and converted to markdown format.

The documentation includes:
- **A Tour of Tokio** with examples
- **Authoring libraries** guidance
- **Working With Tasks** - how to manage async tasks
- **CPU-bound tasks and blocking code** - handling blocking operations
- **Asynchronous IO** patterns
- **Examples** for various use cases
- **Feature flags** including unstable features
- **Supported platforms** including WASM support

The file is saved at: `/private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-mcp_tool/.llms-fetch-mcp/docs.rs/tokio/index`

You can read from this cached file or I can help you explore specific sections. What would you like to know about tokio?
