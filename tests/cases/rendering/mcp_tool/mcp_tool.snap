[3] Thinking...
I've fetched the tokio documentation from https://docs.rs/tokio. The content has been saved and converted to markdown at:

```
/private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-mcp_tool/.llms-fetch-mcp/docs.rs/tokio/index
```

The documentation includes these main sections:
- **A Tour of Tokio** - Introduction with examples
- **Authoring libraries** - How to use tokio when writing libraries
- **Working With Tasks** - Task management and async patterns
- **CPU-bound tasks and blocking code** - Handling blocking operations
- **Asynchronous IO** - Async I/O patterns
- **Examples** - Code examples
- **Feature flags** - Available cargo features
- **Platform support** - Supported platforms including WASM support

You can read the full documentation from the saved file. Would you like me to explore any specific section or help you with something related to tokio?
