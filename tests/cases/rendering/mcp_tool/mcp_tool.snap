[3] Thinking...
I've successfully fetched the tokio documentation from https://docs.rs/tokio. The content has been cached locally and includes:

**Main sections:**
- A Tour of Tokio with examples
- Authoring libraries
- Working With Tasks
- CPU-bound tasks and blocking code
- Asynchronous IO
- Examples
- Feature flags (including unstable features)
- Supported platforms (with WASM support information)

The documentation is now saved and ready for reference. Would you like me to search for specific information within the tokio docs, or help you with something related to tokio?
