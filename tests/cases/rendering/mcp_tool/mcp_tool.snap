Done! I've fetched the tokio documentation from https://docs.rs/tokio. The content has been saved locally and covers:

- **A Tour of Tokio** - Introduction and examples
- **Working With Tasks** - Task spawning and management
- **CPU-bound tasks and blocking code** - How to handle blocking operations
- **Asynchronous IO** - Async I/O patterns
- **Feature flags** - Available cargo features
- **Platform support** - Including WASM support

The documentation is now available for reference. Let me know if you'd like me to find specific information in the docs or help you with tokio-related questions!
