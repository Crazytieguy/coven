I've successfully fetched the Tokio documentation from https://docs.rs/tokio. The documentation has been saved and converted to markdown.

The docs include sections on:
- **A Tour of Tokio** - Introduction with examples
- **Working With Tasks** - Async task management
- **CPU-bound tasks and blocking code** - Handling blocking operations
- **Asynchronous IO** - Async I/O patterns
- **Examples** - Code examples
- **Feature flags** - Configuration options
- **Supported platforms** - Platform compatibility
- **WASM support** - WebAssembly support

The file is saved at `/private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-mcp_tool/.llms-fetch-mcp/docs.rs/tokio/index` and contains about 363 lines of content.

What would you like to do with the documentation?
