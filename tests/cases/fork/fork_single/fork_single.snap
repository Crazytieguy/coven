[1] Thinking...
I'll delegate creating the greeting.txt file as a self-contained fork subtask.

<fork>
- Create greeting.txt with content 'Hello from a forked subtask!'
</fork>

[2] ⑂ Fork  Create greeting.txt with content 'Hello from a forked subtask!'
  [2/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
[3] ⑂ Fork Result
[4] Thinking...
Perfect! The fork subtask has completed successfully. The file `greeting.txt` has been created with the content 'Hello from a forked subtask!' in your working directory.
