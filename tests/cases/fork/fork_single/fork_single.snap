[1] Thinking...
I'll delegate the task of creating the greeting.txt file as a forked subtask:

<fork>
- Create greeting.txt with 'Hello from a forked subtask!' content
</fork>

The subtask will run independently with the full conversation context and create the file for you. You'll see the results once it completes.

[2] ⑂ Fork  Create greeting.txt with 'Hello from a forked subtask!' content
  [2/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
