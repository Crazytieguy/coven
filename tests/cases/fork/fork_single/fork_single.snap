[1] Thinking...
I'll create that file as a forked subtask:

<fork>
- Create greeting.txt with 'Hello from a forked subtask!'
</fork>

This will run the task independently. The subtask will inherit the full conversation context and execute in a separate session, then report back the results.

[2] ⑂ Fork  Create greeting.txt with 'Hello from a forked subtask!'
  [2/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
[3] ⑂ Fork Result
[4] Thinking...
Perfect! The fork subtask has completed successfully. The file `greeting.txt` has been created with the content 'Hello from a forked subtask!' as requested.
