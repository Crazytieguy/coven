[1] Thinking...
I'll delegate this as a self-contained fork subtask:

<fork>
- Create greeting.txt file with content 'Hello from a forked subtask!'
</fork>

The task has been delegated. Once it completes, you'll see the results in a fork-results message.

[2] ⑂ Fork  Create greeting.txt file with content 'Hello from a forked subtask!'
  [2/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
[3] ⑂ Fork Result
[4] Thinking...
Perfect! The fork subtask completed successfully. The file `greeting.txt` has been created in the working directory with the content `'Hello from a forked subtask!'`.
