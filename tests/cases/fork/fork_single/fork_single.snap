[1] Thinking...
I'll delegate this as a forked subtask:

<fork>
- Create greeting.txt file with 'Hello from a forked subtask!' content
</fork>

The forked subtask will inherit your full conversation context and run independently. You'll receive the results when it completes.

[2] ⑂ Fork  Create greeting.txt file with 'Hello from a forked subtask!' content
  [2/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
[3] ⑂ Fork Result
[4] Thinking...
Perfect! The forked subtask has completed successfully. The file `greeting.txt` has been created with the content 'Hello from a forked subtask!' in the independent session.
