[1] Thinking...
I'll use fork to delegate these two file creation tasks in parallel:

<fork>
- Create hello.txt with 'hello world'
- Create goodbye.txt with 'goodbye world'
</fork>

[2] ⑂ Fork  Create hello.txt with 'hello world'
[3] ⑂ Fork  Create goodbye.txt with 'goodbye world'
  [2/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
  [3/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
[4] ⑂ Fork Result
[5] Thinking...
Perfect! Both files have been created successfully:
- ✓ `hello.txt` with content 'hello world'
- ✓ `goodbye.txt` with content 'goodbye world'

The fork delegation ran both tasks concurrently and completed them without any issues.
