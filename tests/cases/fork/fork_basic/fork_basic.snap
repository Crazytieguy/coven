[1] Thinking...
I'll use fork to delegate these two file creation tasks concurrently.

<fork>
- Create hello.txt with content 'hello world'
- Create goodbye.txt with content 'goodbye world'
</fork>

[2] ⑂ Fork  Create hello.txt with content 'hello world'
[3] ⑂ Fork  Create goodbye.txt with content 'goodbye world'
  [2/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
  [3/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
[4] ⑂ Fork Result
[5] Thinking...
Perfect! Both files have been created successfully:
- **hello.txt** with content 'hello world'
- **goodbye.txt** with content 'goodbye world'

The fork delegated both file creation tasks concurrently and they completed without issues.
