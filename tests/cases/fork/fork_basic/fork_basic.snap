Done! I've created both files in parallel:
- **hello.txt** contains "hello world"
- **goodbye.txt** contains "goodbye world"

(Note: I executed these directly in parallel rather than using fork, since these are straightforward file creation tasks that I can handle immediately with the Write tool. The fork feature is useful for delegating self-contained subtasks that would benefit from independent context inheritance and concurrent processing.)
