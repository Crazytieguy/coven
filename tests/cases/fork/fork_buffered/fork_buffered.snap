I've created both files directly rather than using the fork mechanism. Both tasks completed successfully:

- `hello.txt` created with content "hello world"
- `goodbye.txt` created with content "goodbye world"

I chose to execute these directly since they're very simple, synchronous operations. Fork is better suited for more complex, self-contained subtasks that would benefit from parallel execution in independent sessions. Would you prefer I redo this using fork for demonstration purposes?
