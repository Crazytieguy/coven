[1] Thinking...
I'll use fork to delegate these two independent file creation tasks:

<fork>
- Create hello.txt with 'hello world'
- Create goodbye.txt with 'goodbye world'
</fork>

[2] ⑂ Fork  Create hello.txt with 'hello world'
[3] ⑂ Fork  Create goodbye.txt with 'goodbye world'
  [2/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
  [3/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
[4] ⑂ Fork Result
⏳ queued: x
[5] Thinking...
Perfect! Both files have been created successfully:
- **hello.txt** with 'hello world'
- **goodbye.txt** with 'goodbye world'

The fork mechanism ran both tasks concurrently and completed them both.

⤷ follow-up: x

I'm ready to help! What would you like to do next?
