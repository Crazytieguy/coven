[1] Thinking...
> I'll use fork to delegate these two file creation tasks in parallel:

<fork>
- Create hello.txt with 'hello world'
- Create goodbye.txt with 'goodbye world'
</fork>

[2] ⑂ Fork  Create hello.txt with 'hello world'
[3] ⑂ Fork  Create goodbye.txt with 'goodbye world'
  [2/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
  [3/1] Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
[4] ⑂ Fork Result
⏳ queued: x
[5] Thinking...
Perfect! Both files have been created successfully:
- ✓ hello.txt with 'hello world'
- ✓ goodbye.txt with 'goodbye world'

The fork delegated both tasks to run concurrently, and they completed in parallel.

⤷ follow-up: x
[6] Thinking...
I'm not sure what you need—could you clarify? Are you looking to:
- Delete those files?
- Verify the files were created?
- Do something else?

Let me know how I can help!
