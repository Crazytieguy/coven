[1] Thinking...
I'll find all the Python files in this directory and read them one by one.

[2] ▶ Glob  *.py
Enter steer · Alt+Enter follow up · :N view message · Esc cancel
⤷ steering: count lines instead
[3] Thinking...
Now I'll read each file and provide summaries:

[4] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...
[5] Thinking...
I see you'd like me to count lines instead. Just to clarify - would you like me to:

1. **Just count the lines** in each file (no summaries)?
2. **Count lines AND provide summaries** for each file?
3. **Count total lines** across all files?

What's the best approach for what you're looking for?
