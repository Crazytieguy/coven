⤷ steering: Actually, just count the lines in each file instead
[1] Thinking...
I'll find all Python files in this directory and read them one at a time with summaries.

[2] ▶ Glob  *.py
[3] Thinking...
Got it! Let me count the lines in each Python file instead.

[4] ▶ Bash  wc -l /tmp/coven-vcr-steering/*.py
    ✗ Error: This command requires approval
[5] Thinking...
[6] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-steering/hello.py
[7] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-steering/counter.py
[8] Thinking...
Here are the line counts for each Python file:

- **hello.py**: 3 lines
- **counter.py**: 5 lines
