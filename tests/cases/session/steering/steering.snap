[1] Thinking...
I'll help you read and summarize each Python file in the directory. Let me start by finding all the .py files.

[2] ▶ Glob  *.py
⤷ steering: count lines instead
[3] Thinking...
Found 4 Python files. Let me read and summarize each one:

[4] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-steering/hello.py
[5] Thinking...
**hello.py** - 2 lines

Now let me read the remaining files and count their lines:

[6] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-steering/greet.py
[7] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-steering/counter.py
[8] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-steering/fib.py
[9] Thinking...
Here's a line count summary of all Python files in the directory:

| File | Lines |
|------|-------|
| hello.py | 2 |
| greet.py | 4 |
| counter.py | 4 |
| fib.py | 8 |
| **Total** | **18** |
