Session d6e11e31-82ed-4c8e-9649-a3ed82aaf7fd (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)

[1] Thinking...
The user wants me to:
1. Write a hello world script to hello.py
2. Change the greeting to "hi" instead of "hello"

This is straightforward. I should create a Python script with a "hi world" greeting (or similar) in hello.py.

Let me use the Write tool to create this file.

[3] Thinking...
Great! I've successfully created the hello.py file with a "Hi, World!" greeting instead of "Hello, World!". The file has been created at the requested location with the greeting changed to "hi" as requested.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a greeting changed to "Hi, World!"
