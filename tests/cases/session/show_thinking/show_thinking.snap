Session 85c9f38d-e3e4-4a17-9020-7f8850bc1d9e (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)

[1] Thinking...
The user wants me to:
1. Write a hello world script to hello.py
2. Change the greeting to say "hi" instead of "hello"

This is straightforward. I should create a hello.py file with a simple script that prints "hi world" (or similar with "hi" instead of "hello").

Let me write this file.

[3] Thinking...
Great! I've created the hello.py file with the greeting changed to "hi" instead of "hello". The file now contains a simple Python script that prints "hi world".

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the greeting changed to "hi":

```python
print("hi world")
```
