Session 11d901f0-b904-4a79-ad3e-d25c1f9d24c9 (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)

[1] Thinking...
The user wants me to:
1. Write a hello world script to hello.py
2. Change the greeting to "hi" instead of "hello"

This is a straightforward task. I should create a Python script with "Hi" greeting. Let me use the Write tool to create this file.

The user's global instructions say if there are questions and instructions, questions take precedent, but this request is just instructions with no questions, so I should proceed.

[3] Thinking...
Great! I've successfully created the hello.py file with the greeting changed to "Hi, world!" instead of "Hello, world!". The task is complete.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a "Hi, world!" greeting.
