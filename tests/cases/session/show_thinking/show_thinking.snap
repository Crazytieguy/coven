Session 13fa5946-0fab-49fa-a8a7-bf69c6020234 (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)

[1] Thinking...
The user wants me to:
1. Write a hello world script to hello.py
2. Change the greeting to "hi" instead of "hello"

This is straightforward - I need to create a file called hello.py with a simple script that prints "hi" instead of the typical "hello world".

Since the user is asking me to create a new file, I should use the Write tool to create hello.py with the appropriate content.

[2] ▶ Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn...
[3] Thinking...
Perfect! I've successfully created the hello.py file with the greeting changed to "hi" instead of "hello". The file contains a simple print statement that outputs "hi world".

Done! I've created hello.py with the greeting changed to "hi". The file contains:
```python
print("hi world")
```
