Session 4f69867d-319a-4b1c-8ed6-4acffbba975a (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)

[1] Thinking...
The user wants me to:
1. Write a hello world script to hello.py
2. Change the greeting to "hi" instead of "hello"

This is straightforward - I should create a simple Python script that prints "hi world" instead of "hello world".

Since the file doesn't exist yet, I'll use the Write tool to create it with the content.

[3] Thinking...
Done! I've created a hello.py file with the greeting changed to "hi" as requested. The script prints "hi world" instead of the traditional "hello world".

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a greeting of "hi world".
