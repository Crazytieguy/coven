Session 443ec202-b69d-4a58-a6c0-5e11c5090e19 (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)

[1] Thinking...
The user wants me to:
1. Write a hello world script to hello.py
2. Change the greeting to "hi" (instead of "hello")

This is straightforward - I need to create a simple Python script that prints "hi world" instead of the traditional "hello world".

I'll use the Write tool to create the file hello.py with content that prints "hi world".

[3] Thinking...
Great! I've successfully created the hello.py file with the greeting changed from "hello" to "hi". The script prints "hi world" when executed.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the greeting changed to "hi":

```python
print("hi world")
```
