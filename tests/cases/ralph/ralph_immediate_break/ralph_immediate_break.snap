Session 911e5e84-6a54-438e-8ca7-0e7ef37caa23 (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)

[1] Thinking...
I'll check the TODO.md file for any unchecked tasks.

[2] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-ralph_immediate_break/TODO.md
[3] Thinking...
All tasks in TODO.md are already checked and completed:
- ✅ Create a hello.py that prints 'hi'
- ✅ Create a README.md with the title 'My Project'

Since there are no unchecked tasks remaining, I'm stopping here.

<break>All TODO tasks are completed</break>


Done  $0.01 · 3.5s · 2 turns  (:N to view)
