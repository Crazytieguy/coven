[7] Thinking...
Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content that prints 'hi' and marked the first task as complete. There's still one unchecked task remaining: "Create a README.md with the title 'My Project'". I'll continue with that in the next iteration.

[8] Thinking...
I'll check the TODO.md file for unchecked tasks.

[9] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-ralph_break/TODO.md
[10] Thinking...
I found one unchecked task: "Create a README.md with the title 'My Project'". Let me do that now.

[11] ▶ Write  (1 line)  /tmp/coven-vcr-ralph_break/README.md
[12] Thinking...
Now I'll mark the task as done in TODO.md:

[13] ▶ Edit  /tmp/coven-vcr-ralph_break/TODO.md
[14] Thinking...
Let me verify all tasks are now complete:

[15] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-ralph_break/TODO.md
[16] Thinking...
All tasks are complete! Both tasks are now checked:
- ✓ Create a hello.py that prints 'hi'
- ✓ Create a README.md with the title 'My Project'

<break>All TODO tasks are completed</break>
