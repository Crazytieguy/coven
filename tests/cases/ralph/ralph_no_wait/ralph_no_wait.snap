Looking at TODO.md, all tasks are already marked as complete:

- [x] Create a hello.py that prints 'hi'
- [x] Create a README.md with the title 'My Project'

There are no unchecked tasks remaining in this file. Would you like me to:
1. Add new tasks to TODO.md?
2. Verify that the completed tasks (hello.py and README.md) are properly created and committed?

3. Something else?

[36] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-ralph_no_wait/TODO.md
[37] Thinking...
Looking at TODO.md, I can see that all tasks are already checked:
- [x] Create a hello.py that prints 'hi'
- [x] Create a README.md with the title 'My Project'

There are no unchecked tasks remaining. Both items have been marked as completed. However, I notice from the git status that these files are showing as untracked (hello.py and README.md), which suggests they may have been created but not yet staged/committed.

Would you like me to:
1. Create additional tasks in TODO.md?
2. Stage and commit the existing files?
3. Something else?
