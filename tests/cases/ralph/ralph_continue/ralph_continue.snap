[1] Thinking...
I'll check TODO.md for unchecked tasks.

[2] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-ralph_continue/TODO.md
[3] Thinking...
I found two unchecked tasks. I'll do the first one - create a hello.py that prints 'hi'.

[4] ▶ Write  (1 line)  /tmp/coven-vcr-ralph_continue/hello.py
[5] Thinking...
Now I'll mark the task as done in TODO.md:

[6] ▶ Edit  /tmp/coven-vcr-ralph_continue/TODO.md
[7] Thinking...
Done! I've completed the first task:
- Created `hello.py` with `print('hi')`
- Marked it as done in TODO.md

One task remains unchecked: Create a README.md with the title 'My Project'
