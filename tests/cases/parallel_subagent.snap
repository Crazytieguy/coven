## Summary of Both Files

**README.md:**
The file describes a "Test Project" - a minimal project designed for testing parallel subagent display in coven. It's a very simple README with just a title and one-line description.

**notes.txt:**
Contains a single line of placeholder text: "These are test notes for the parallel subagent test case." It was created for testing purposes related to parallel subagent functionality.

Both files are minimal test fixtures for evaluating the coven system's parallel subagent capabilities.
