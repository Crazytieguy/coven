[1] Thinking...
I'll help you modify greeting.py. Let me first read the file to see its current contents.

Now I'll update the greeting and add a farewell line.

Done! I've updated greeting.py to:
- Change the greeting from 'hello' to 'goodbye'
- Add a farewell line that prints 'See you soon!'

The function will now output both the goodbye message and the farewell line when called.
