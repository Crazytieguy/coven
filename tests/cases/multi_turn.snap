Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Key characteristics:

- **Memory safety** without garbage collection, enforced through its ownership and borrowing system
- **Zero-cost abstractions** — high-level features compile down to efficient low-level code
- **Fearless concurrency** — the type system prevents data races at compile time
- **No null or dangling pointers** — uses `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` instead
- **Cargo** — built-in package manager and build system

It was created at Mozilla Research and first released in 2015. It's commonly used for systems programming, WebAssembly, CLI tools, embedded systems, and increasingly in areas traditionally dominated by C/C++.

Rust's ownership system is a set of compile-time rules that manage memory without a garbage collector:

**Three core rules:**
1. Each value has exactly one **owner** (a variable)
2. There can only be **one owner at a time**
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is **dropped** (freed)

**Move semantics:**
```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;        // s1 is "moved" to s2
// println!("{s1}"); // compile error — s1 is no longer valid
```

**Borrowing** lets you reference a value without taking ownership:
```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
let len = calculate_length(&s); // borrows s, doesn't take ownership
// s is still valid here
```

**Borrowing rules:**
- You can have **either** one mutable reference (`&mut T`) **or** any number of immutable references (`&T`) — never both at the same time
- References must always be valid (no dangling references)

**Clone** for explicit deep copies:
```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone(); // both s1 and s2 are valid
```

Simple types like integers implement `Copy`, so they're copied automatically rather than moved. The compiler enforces all of this at build time with no runtime cost.
