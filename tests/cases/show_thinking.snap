Session b4486c9d-9733-4f04-8884-f3629e7be436 (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)

[1] Thinking...
The user wants me to:
1. Write a hello world script to hello.py
2. Change the greeting to "hi" instead of the standard "hello world"

This is straightforward. I need to create a file called hello.py with a simple script that prints "hi" instead of "hello world".

Let me write this file using the Write tool.

[3] Thinking...
Done! I've created a hello.py file with a simple script that prints "hi" instead of the traditional "hello world". The file was created successfully.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a simple script that prints "hi".
