Session dd3ddcab-8c65-4bbe-b2a9-2e74a6b9d4d7 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

[1] Thinking...
The user wants me to:
1. Write a hello world script to hello.py
2. Change the greeting to "hi" instead of "hello"

This is a simple, straightforward task. I should:
1. Write a Python script to hello.py that prints "Hi world" (or similar)

Since the user said to write a hello world script and then change the greeting to "hi", I interpret this as writing a script that says "Hi world" rather than "Hello world".

This is a simple task that doesn't require planning or a todo list - it's just creating one simple file.

I'll create a hello.py script with "Hi" as the greeting.

[3] Thinking...
Good! I've created the hello.py file with "Hi world" as the greeting. The user asked me to write a hello world script and change the greeting to "hi", which I've done in one step.

Done! I've created hello.py with "Hi world" as the greeting instead of the traditional "Hello world".
