Session fa466502-b9c0-43e6-ac3f-3f905453fd7d (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)

[1] Thinking...
The user wants me to:
1. Write a hello world script to hello.py
2. Change the greeting to "hi" instead of "hello"

This is straightforward - I need to create a hello.py file with a simple script that prints a greeting, but using "hi" instead of "hello".

Let me use the Write tool to create this file.

[2] ▶ Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn...
[3] Thinking...
Done! I've created the hello.py file with a greeting that says "Hi, World!" instead of "Hello, World!". This satisfies both requirements:
1. Created a hello world script to hello.py
2. Changed the greeting to "hi"

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the greeting changed to "Hi, World!" instead of "Hello, World!".
