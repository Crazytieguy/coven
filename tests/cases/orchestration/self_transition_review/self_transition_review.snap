Task completed! I've successfully implemented the `merge_intervals` function in `src/intervals.py`. The function:

- Takes a list of `[start, end]` intervals
- Handles empty input by returning an empty list
- Sorts intervals by start time
- Merges overlapping or adjacent intervals by checking if the next interval's start is <= the current merged interval's end
- Returns the merged, sorted intervals

Changes have been landed to main.
