I'll help you work on this board issue. Let me start by reading the relevant files to understand the current state.

Now let me read the existing calc.py file to understand its structure:

I'll start by reading the board and checking for any existing context.

Good! I can see this is session 2 (review session). The implementation was already done. Let me verify the changes by looking at the actual code and the diff.

[27] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

[29] Thinking...
Perfect! The implementation is complete and correct. The `subtract` function:
- Takes two arguments ✅
- Returns their difference ✅
- Follows the same pattern as the existing `add` function ✅

Now I'll finalize by moving the issue to the Done section and landing the changes.

Done! ✅ The subtract function implementation has been reviewed and verified:
- Function correctly takes two arguments and returns their difference
- Follows the same pattern as the existing `add` function
- All changes have been landed to main
