I'll plan the board issue for you. Let me start by reading the relevant files.

Now let me explore the codebase to understand the current structure and requirements.

Now I'll create a plan. Based on my exploration, the specification is fairly clear but has some ambiguities worth clarifying before implementation.

Perfect! I've created a plan for the `merge_intervals` function. Here's what I surfaced:

**Plan Summary:**
- **Issue moved to Blocked:** Awaiting human input on key design decisions
- **Clarified decisions:** Empty input returns empty list, no input mutation, standard overlap handling
- **Key questions:**
  - Should adjacent intervals (like `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]`) merge? This is a common ambiguity in interval merging
  - Input validation requirements (error handling, type support)
  - Data type support (integers only vs floats)

The plan has been committed and landed. Ready for human review.

Looking at the current state:

**Board Status:**
- `# Blocked`: P1 "Add merge_intervals function" — has 3 unanswered questions about adjacent interval merging, input validation, and supported data types
- No issues under `# Plan` or `# Ready`

**Sync Analysis:**
The brief contains the same task description as what's already on the board under `# Blocked`. The human hasn't provided answers to the open questions yet, so nothing has changed on the board — no new entries to add or decisions to incorporate.

**Task Selection:**
The only task on the board is blocked awaiting human input (questions about design decisions). There are no plan or ready items to work on.
