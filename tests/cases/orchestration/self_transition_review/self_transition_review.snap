I'll start by reading the board and scratch files to understand the current state of this task.

Now I'll add the subtract function to src/calc.py:

[18] Thinking...
Now I'll commit this change:

[19] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[20] Thinking...
Now I'll create scratch.md to track progress:

[21] ▶ Write  (11 lines)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w000...
[22] Thinking...
Now let me review the implementation by checking the diff:

[23] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[24] Thinking...
The diff looks good! The implementation meets the requirements:
- ✅ Function named `subtract`
- ✅ Takes two arguments `(a, b)`
- ✅ Returns their difference `(a - b)`

Now I'll move the issue to Done in board.md and land:

[25] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[26] Thinking...
[27] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git commit -m "Move issue to Done: Add subtr...
[28] Thinking...
[29] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[30] Thinking...
[31] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md
[32] Thinking...
Perfect! I've successfully completed the task:

✅ **Added subtract function** to src/calc.py that takes two arguments and returns their difference
✅ **Verified the implementation** matches the requirements  
✅ **Landed the changes** to main
✅ **Cleaned up** by deleting scratch.md

The work is complete. Transitioning to dispatch for next steps.

**Sync Analysis:**

The brief requests adding a `subtract` function to src/calc.py. This work is already in the Done section of the board, so no new entries need to be created. The board is in sync with the brief.

**Open Questions:**
None - the board has no questions awaiting answers above the divider.

**Actionable Work:**
None - there are no entries below the divider. All work has been completed.

**Decision:**
No actionable work remains. Sleeping.
