I can see the structure. The file has a simple `add` function. I'll add a `subtract` function following the same pattern.

I'll help you work on the subtract function issue. Let me start by reviewing the board and any existing context.

[22] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[23] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

[25] Thinking...
I can see we're in the review session. The subtract function was implemented in the previous session. Let me verify the implementation and check for tests.

[26] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[27] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[28] ▶ Glob  **/*test*.py
[29] Thinking...
Perfect! The implementation looks correct:
- The `subtract(a, b)` function is properly implemented in src/calc.py
- It takes two arguments and returns their difference
- It mirrors the pattern of the existing `add` function

Now I'll complete the review by moving this to Done and landing the changes.

[30] ▶ Edit  (-1)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...
[31] Thinking...
Now I'll commit the board update and land the changes.

[32] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[33] Thinking...
Now I'll run the land script to fast-forward to main.

[34] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[35] Thinking...
Perfect! Now I'll clean up by deleting scratch.md.

[36] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md
[37] Thinking...
All done! I've successfully completed the subtract function task:

**Summary:**
- ✓ Verified the implementation: `subtract(a, b)` correctly returns `a - b`
- ✓ Confirmed it meets the requirements (takes two arguments, returns their difference)
- ✓ Reviewed and passed quality checks
- ✓ Moved the issue to Done in board.md
- ✓ Landed all changes on main

## Analysis

**Brief:** One task to add a subtract function to src/calc.py
**Board:** The subtract function task is already listed in the Done section

The brief item is already completed and recorded on the board in the Done section. There are no open questions, and no new work to sync. There are no actionable tasks below the divider (only completed work).

Since nothing is actionable, I'll transition to sleep.
