[1] Thinking...
I'll read the brief and board to sync work and pick a task.

[4] Thinking...
Now I'll sync the work onto the board. The brief has one task that isn't on the board yet, so I'll add it as a P1 entry below the divider (ready to implement).

**Sync complete.** Board now has one P1 task synced from the brief:
- **P1: Add subtract function to src/calc.py** — ready to implement

**Picking task:** P1 (the only actionable item), no open questions, proceeding with implementation.

This is straightforward. I'll add the subtract function following the same pattern as the existing `add` function.

[25] Thinking...
I'll start by reading the board and scratch files to understand the task and any previous context.

[26] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

[28] Thinking...
I can see this is a review session. The subtract function was already added in session 1. Let me verify the implementation by checking the code and reviewing the diff.

[29] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[30] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[31] Thinking...
Perfect! The implementation looks good. The `subtract` function:
- Takes two arguments as required
- Returns their difference
- Follows the same pattern as the existing `add` function

Now I'll move the issue to the Done section and land the changes.

[32] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[33] Thinking...
Now I'll commit the board update and land the changes.

[34] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[35] Thinking...
Now I'll land the changes and clean up.

[36] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[37] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md
[38] Thinking...
Complete! I've reviewed and landed the changes:

- ✓ Verified the `subtract` function implementation (takes two args, returns their difference)
- ✓ Moved the issue to the Done section
- ✓ Landed the changes to main
- ✓ Cleaned up scratch.md

## Sync Analysis

**Brief:** Contains one task — "Add a `subtract` function to src/calc.py"

**Board:** This task is already in the Done section, marked as completed.

**Result:** No new work to sync. The requested task has already been completed in a previous session (confirmed by recent commits including "Add subtract function to src/calc.py" and "Move 'Add subtract function' to Done").

## Actionable Tasks

There are no open issues above the divider and no tasks below the divider to pick. All requested work is complete.

**Reasoning:** The brief contained one task which is already resolved and in Done. No actionable work remains.
