**Synced and landed.** The brief contained one task: adding a `subtract` function to src/calc.py. I've added it to the board as **P1: Add subtract function to src/calc.py** and landed the change.

**Reasoning:** One P1 task is ready to implement with no open questions. Picking it now.

I'll help you work on adding a subtract function to src/calc.py. Let me start by reading the board and checking the current state.

[13] Thinking...
Good, this is the first session. Let me read the current src/calc.py to understand the existing structure.

[14] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[15] Thinking...
Perfect! The file has a simple `add` function. I'll add a `subtract` function following the same pattern.

[16] ▶ Edit  (+4)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...
[17] Thinking...
Now let me commit this change and create a scratch.md file to document the work.

[18] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[19] Thinking...
Now I'll create a scratch.md file to document the session and plan the next steps.

[21] Thinking...
Perfect! I've completed the implementation of the subtract function. Here's what I did:

**Session 1 Summary:**
- ✅ Examined the existing code structure (simple `add` function)
- ✅ Added `subtract(a, b)` function that takes two arguments and returns their difference
- ✅ Committed the change

The implementation is straightforward and follows the same pattern as the existing `add` function. Next session will be a review to verify it meets the acceptance criteria, then I'll land the work.

I'll start by reviewing the board and any previous session notes.

[23] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

[25] Thinking...
I can see the implementation was done in the first session. Now I need to review the work. Let me check the diff and verify the implementation.

[26] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[27] Thinking...
Great! The implementation looks correct:
- Added a `subtract(a, b)` function that returns `a - b`
- Follows the same pattern as the existing `add` function
- Meets the acceptance criteria

Now I'll complete the review process:

[28] ▶ Edit  (-2)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...

[34] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md
[35] Thinking...
Perfect! I've completed the review session:

✅ **Review**: The subtract function implementation is correct - it takes two arguments and returns their difference, matching the acceptance criteria.

✅ **Completed**: 
- Moved issue to Done in board.md
- Committed the board update
- Landed work to main via `.coven/land.sh`
- Deleted scratch.md

## Analysis

**Brief.md:** Contains one item - add a `subtract` function to src/calc.py

**Board.md:** Shows the `subtract` function task is already in the **Done** section

**Sync:** The brief item matches what's in Done, so there's no new work to add to the board.

**Actionable work:** There are no tasks below the divider to pick. All work is complete.

**Conclusion:** The subtract function has been implemented and marked complete. No new work is available.
