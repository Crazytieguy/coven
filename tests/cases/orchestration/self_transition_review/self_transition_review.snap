Now let me create scratch.md to record what I've done and check if there are tests:

[19] ▶ Write  (11 lines)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w000...

Let me commit the changes:

[23] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...

Now let me review the change with a diff from main:

[25] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[26] Thinking...
Perfect! The diff looks good. The `subtract` function is correctly implemented. Now let me finalize by updating the board:

[27] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[28] Thinking...

[30] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md
[31] Thinking...
[32] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[33] Thinking...
Excellent! The task is complete. I've successfully:

1. Added the `subtract` function to `src/calc.py`
2. The function takes two arguments and returns their difference
3. Committed the changes
4. Moved the issue to Done in `board.md`
5. Landed the changes on main

The implementation is clean and follows the same pattern as the existing `add` function.

Looking at the brief and board:

**Brief**: One task to add a `subtract` function to src/calc.py

**Board**: That task is already in the Done section

The work described in the brief has already been completed (commit e7dd475 shows "Mark P1 as done: Add subtract function to src/calc.py"). There are no blocked items above the divider and no actionable items below it.
