I'll read the brief and board to understand the current state.

Looking at the brief and board:

**brief.md** has one task:
- Add a `subtract` function to src/calc.py that takes two arguments and returns their difference.

**board.md** is empty and ready for syncing.

I'll add this task to the board and commit it:

[10] Thinking...
**Sync complete.** I've added the one task from the brief to the board. 

**Task selection:** There's one ready task:
- **P1: Add subtract function to src/calc.py** — straightforward implementation, no blockers

Handing off to main agent to implement this task.

I'll help you work on the subtract function task. Let me start by reading the board and checking for any prior context.

[12] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[13] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
     ✗ Error: File does not exist.
[14] Thinking...
Let me check the existing calc.py file to understand its structure:

[15] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[16] Thinking...
Now I'll add the subtract function following the same pattern:

[17] ▶ Edit  (+4)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...
[18] Thinking...
Now let me commit this change:

[19] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[20] Thinking...
Let me create a scratch file to record my progress and then review the work:

[21] ▶ Write  (14 lines)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w000...
[22] Thinking...
Let me review the diff to verify the work:

[23] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[24] Thinking...
Perfect! The implementation meets the acceptance criteria. Now I'll finalize by moving the issue to Done and landing the changes:

[25] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[26] Thinking...
Now I'll commit the board update:

[27] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git commit -m "Move subtract function task t...
[28] Thinking...
Now I'll land the changes:

[29] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[30] Thinking...
Now I'll delete the scratch file and transition to dispatch:

[31] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md
[32] Thinking...
Done! I've successfully completed the task:

✓ Added `subtract(a, b)` function to src/calc.py
✓ Implementation follows the same pattern as the existing `add()` function
✓ Reviewed and verified the changes meet acceptance criteria
✓ Landed changes to main branch
