[11] Thinking...
I'll start by reading the board and checking for any previous context.

[14] Thinking...
This is the first session. Let me read the existing `src/calc.py` to understand the structure and patterns.

[15] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[16] Thinking...
Now I'll add the `subtract` function following the existing pattern.

Now I'll create `scratch.md` to record my progress:

[22] Thinking...
Now let me review the changes by checking the diff:

[23] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[24] Thinking...
The diff looks good! The subtract function has been added correctly. Now I'll update `board.md` to move this to the Done section:

[28] Thinking...
[29] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[30] Thinking...
[31] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md
[32] Thinking...
Perfect! I've successfully completed the task:

✅ **Added subtract function** to `src/calc.py` that takes two arguments and returns their difference
✅ **Committed changes** with proper attribution
✅ **Marked issue as done** in board.md
✅ **Landed changes** to main branch
✅ **Cleaned up** scratch.md

The subtract function follows the same simple pattern as the existing add function and is ready to use.

Both files are in sync. The brief item "Add a `subtract` function to src/calc.py" is already completed and appears in the Done section of the board. There are no new items to sync, no open questions, and no actionable work remaining.

Reasoning: All tasks from the brief are marked as done on the board, and there are no throttling issues (0 open questions, so even P2 work would be eligible). However, there's nothing below the divider to pick—all work is complete.
