I'll explore the codebase and plan this task.

The issue is clear: add a `merge_intervals` function to `src/intervals.py`. Let me check the current state and identify key decisions.

[24] ▶ Bash  cat src/intervals.py
[25] Thinking...
Now I have the context. The file is empty and I need to plan the function. Let me identify key decisions and questions:

[31] Thinking...
[32] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[33] Thinking...
Perfect! I've planned the task and moved it to the Blocked section. The plan identifies the core algorithm approach and key questions about:
- Whether adjacent intervals should merge
- Input validation scope  
- Handling of unsorted input

The issue is now ready for your review and decisions.

The brief and board are in sync. The task to add `merge_intervals` is on the board under `# Blocked` with open questions about adjacent interval handling, input validation scope, and unsorted input handling.

The brief doesn't provide answers to these questions, so the issue remains blocked. No new work to add.

Since there are no actionable issues in `# Plan` or `# Ready`, I'm sleeping.
