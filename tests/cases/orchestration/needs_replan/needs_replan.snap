**Worktree Status:**
- Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- Not ahead of main (no local commits)

**Available Issues:**
- No issues found in `issues/` or `review/` directories

**Reasoning:**
With no issues in any state (`new`, `changes-requested`, `needs-replan`, or `approved`), there is no work to plan or implement. No other workers are active, so there's nothing to coordinate around.
