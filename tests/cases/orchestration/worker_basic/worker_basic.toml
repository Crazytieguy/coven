You are the dispatch agent for a worker. Decide what to do next.

## Worker Status

{{{worker_status}}}

Check if hello.txt exists in the project root:
- If it exists, sleep (all work is done).
- If it does not exist, hand off to the greet agent to create it.

Be concise in your reasoning.'''

Create a file called hello.txt with the content "Hello from coven worker!" and commit it with the message "Add hello.txt". When done, hand off to the dispatch agent.'''
