## Reasoning

I've synced the brief to the board. Both tasks are actionable (ready to implement, below the divider). There are no open questions blocking work. 

I'm picking **P0: Fix README description** first—highest priority.

I'll start by reading the board and scratch files to understand the issue.

[16] Thinking...
Now I'll make the required change to README.md:

[17] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[18] Thinking...

[22] Thinking...
Now let me verify the change looks correct:

[23] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[24] Thinking...
The change looks good. Now I'll update the board to remove the completed issue:

[25] ▶ Edit  (-4)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...

[32] Thinking...
Done! I've successfully completed the "Fix README description" issue:

- Changed "A sample project." to "A sample project for demonstration." in README.md
- Removed the completed issue from board.md

## Sync Analysis

**Brief vs Board:**

**Status:** Board is in sync. No new items or answered questions to process.

## Task Selection

**Reasoning:**
- Zero open questions (nothing throttling)
- P1 "Improve main.py" is ready below the divider
- Pick this single actionable task

<next>
agent: main

I'll start by reading the board and understanding what work needs to be done.

Now I'll wrap the print statement in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard:

Now let me review the diff to verify the changes:

[54] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[55] Thinking...
Perfect! The diff shows the print statement is now properly wrapped. Let me remove the completed issue from board.md:

Done! I've completed the P1: Improve main.py issue:

- ✅ Wrapped the print statement in `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard
- ✅ Reviewed the changes
- ✅ Removed the issue from board.md
- ✅ Landed the changes on main

The implementation is complete and the branch is synced with main.
