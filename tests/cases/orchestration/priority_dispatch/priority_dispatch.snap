Looking at the brief and board:

**Sync status:** The board is already in sync with the brief. The P0 task (Fix README description) is marked Done, and the P1 task (Improve main.py) is on the board and ready to implement.

**Actionable work:** 1 P1 issue ready to implement, no open questions.

**Throttling:** Not applicable. No issues are waiting for answers, so P1 work is available.

**Selection reasoning:** The P1: Improve main.py task is ready to implement and is the only actionable work available. Proceeding with this task.

**Sync Status:** ✓ Board is in sync

Both items from `brief.md` are already completed and in the Done section:
- P0: Fix README description
- P1: Improve main.py

**Actionable Tasks:** None

The board has no items above or below the divider. All work from the brief has been completed.

Since there are no open questions and no actionable items to pick, I'll transition to sleep.
