I'll now sync the brief items to the board. Both tasks are straightforward with no questions, so they go below the divider as ready-to-implement.

## Sync Complete

I've synced both brief items to the board:
- **P0: Fix README description** — straightforward text replacement
- **P1: Improve main.py** — add `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard

No open questions. Both tasks are ready to implement.

## Pick Task

**Picking P0: Fix README description** — highest priority, no blockers.

**Review:** The change looks correct. The README.md now reads "A sample project for demonstration." instead of "A sample project." This matches the acceptance criteria. Let me finalize by moving the issue to Done and landing the changes.

Perfect! I can see the task clearly. The file `src/main.py` has a bare `print("hello")` statement that needs to be wrapped in a `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard. Let me make that change:

Great! Now I'll commit this change and then move the issue to Done. First, let me stage and commit:

[51] Thinking...
Now let me land the changes:

[52] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[53] Thinking...
Perfect! The task is complete. I've successfully:

1. Wrapped the `print("hello")` statement in `src/main.py` with an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard
2. Moved the task to Done in the board
3. Landed all changes to main
