**Analysis:**

I found 2 approved issues ready for implementation:
- `fix-readme.md` - **P0** (critical): Update README description
- `improve-main.md` - **P1** (normal): Add if __name__ guard to main.py

No new issues needing planning. No items in review awaiting approval.

**Routing Decision:**

I'm routing the P0 issue to the implement agent since it's the highest priority and ready to work on.

✅ Implementation complete!

I've successfully updated the README.md:
- Changed "A sample project." to "A sample project for demonstration."
- Deleted the issue file
- Committed the changes

The project has no test or linting configuration, so those steps were not applicable. The commit `8b27269` contains the changes.

## Analysis

I found one issue in the codebase:

- **improve-main.md**: Priority P1, State: **approved** ✓

Since this issue is in `approved` state and ready to be implemented, I'll dispatch it to the implement agent.

<dispatch>
agent: implement
issue: issues/improve-main.md
</dispatch>

I'll implement the plan from the issue file. Let me start by reading it.

[48] Thinking...
Now I'll implement the plan by wrapping the print statement in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard.

Let me check if there are any tests or linting configurations to run.

[51] ▶ Glob  pytest.ini
[52] ▶ Glob  tests/**
[53] ▶ Glob  pyproject.toml
[54] ▶ Glob  .pylintrc
[55] Thinking...
Let me verify the change and then commit it.

[56] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[57] Thinking...
Perfect! The change is in place. Now I'll delete the issue file and commit the changes.

[58] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[59] Thinking...
Done! I've successfully implemented the plan:

1. ✅ Wrapped the print statement in `src/main.py` with an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard
2. ✅ Verified the change looks correct
3. ✅ Deleted the issue file
4. ✅ Committed the changes with a descriptive message

The implementation ensures the code only runs when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.
