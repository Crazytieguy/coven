## Sync Check

The brief contains:
- **P0: Fix README description** — already marked Done on the board ✓
- **P1: Improve main.py** — already on the board below the divider ✓

No new items to sync. No board changes needed.

## Pick Task

**Picking: P1: Improve main.py**

Reasoning: One P1 issue is ready to work on. No blocked issues above the divider. Proceeding.

[51] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[52] Thinking...
Task complete! I've successfully:

1. **Wrapped the print statement** in `src/main.py` with an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard
2. **Committed the change** with proper commit message
3. **Landed the changes** to main
4. **Updated the board** to mark P1 as done

The print statement now only executes when `main.py` is run directly, not when imported as a module.

I'll read the brief and board to understand the current state.

**Sync:** Both brief items (P0 and P1) are already complete and in the Done section of the board. The commits confirm they've been implemented. Brief is stale but consistent with board state — no new work to sync.

**Pick:** No actionable issues below the divider. Everything is done.

**Reasoning:** All work is complete. No P0, P1, or P2 issues are pending.
