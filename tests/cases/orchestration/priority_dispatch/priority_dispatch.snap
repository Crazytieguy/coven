[1] Thinking...
I'll read the brief and board files to understand the current state of work.

[2] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...

[4] Thinking...
Now I'll sync the work from the brief onto the board and pick a task.

**Sync Summary:**
- Both brief items (P0 and P1) are new and need board entries
- No open questions, so both entries go below the divider as ready to implement

**Updated board.md:**

**Task Selection:**
- 2 items synced to board (P0 and P1)
- No open questions, all work is ready to implement
- P0 takes priority: "Fix README description"

Transitioning to main agent for implementation.

I'll start by reading the board to understand the issue, and check for any existing scratch notes.

[10] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

[12] Thinking...
Good, I have the context. This is a straightforward task: change "A sample project." to "A sample project for demonstration." in README.md. Let me find and read the README file.

[13] ▶ Glob  README.md
[14] Thinking...
[15] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[16] Thinking...
Now I'll make the text replacement:

[18] Thinking...
[19] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[20] Thinking...
Perfect! Now let me create a scratch.md file to record completion, then move the issue to Done and land the changes.

[21] ▶ Write  (10 lines)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w000...
[22] Thinking...
Now I'll update the board to move the completed issue to Done:

[23] ▶ Edit  (-4)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...

[31] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh

[33] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md
[34] Thinking...
Perfect! The task is complete. I've:
1. Updated README.md with the new description
2. Committed the change
3. Updated the board to mark the issue as Done
4. Landed the changes to main
5. Cleaned up scratch.md

Now transitioning to dispatch for the next task.
