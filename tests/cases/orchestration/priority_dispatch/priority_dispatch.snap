## Summary

**Synced:** Added both brief items to the board (P0 and P1 tasks).

**Picking:** P0 task — "Fix README description" has highest priority and is ready to implement.

**Reasoning:** No open questions above the divider, so no throttling needed. P0 items always get picked.

I'll start by reading the board and any existing scratch file to understand what needs to be done.

[17] Thinking...
Perfect! I can see the README has "A sample project." that needs to be changed. Let me update it:

[18] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[19] Thinking...
Now let me commit this change:

[20] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[21] Thinking...
Now let me create scratch.md to record the progress:

[22] ▶ Write  (9 lines)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
[23] Thinking...
The implementation is complete. Let me now do a review by checking the diff:

[24] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[25] Thinking...
Let me check the current state of board.md:

[26] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[27] Thinking...
Review looks good! The change is exactly as specified. Now I need to complete the landing steps. Let me remove the P0 entry from board.md:

[28] ▶ Edit  (-6)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...
[29] Thinking...
Now commit the board update:

[30] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[31] Thinking...
Now run the land script:

[32] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[33] Thinking...
Perfect! Now delete scratch.md:

[34] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md
[35] Thinking...
## Summary

I've successfully completed the "Fix README description" task:

1. **Updated README.md** - Changed "A sample project." to "A sample project for demonstration."
2. **Committed and reviewed** - The change is correct and minimal
3. **Landed to main** - The changes have been merged to main via the land script
4. **Cleaned up** - Removed board entry and scratch.md

The issue is now complete and ready for the next task.

Looking at the state:

**Sync Analysis:**
- Brief P0 "Fix README description" — Already completed (commits: 01a6842, ca2b95a). No board entry needed.
- Brief P1 "Improve main.py" — Already on board below the divider, ready to implement.

**Board Status:**
- No open questions (divider is at top)
- P1 entry ready for implementation
- Clean sync between brief and board

**Task Selection:**
Picking **P1: Improve main.py** — it's the only actionable task ready to implement, and there are no blocking questions above the divider.

Looking at the brief and board:

**Brief items:**
- P0: Fix README description
- P1: Improve main.py

**Recent commits (from git log):**
- 7a09309: Complete P1: Improve main.py
- ca2b95a: Complete P0: Fix README description

Both brief items have already been completed recently. The board is empty with no open questions or pending work.

**Reasoning:** All work from the brief is done. No open questions above the divider. Nothing to sync. No actionable tasks to pick.
