**Sync complete.** Added 2 tasks from brief:
- P0: Fix README description
- P1: Improve main.py

Both are straightforward with clear specifications, so they go to Ready. No blocked issues. Picking P0 (highest priority) to implement.

I need to commit the board and scratch updates:

[27] ▶ Bash  git add board.md scratch.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

I see, scratch.md is gitignored. Let me just commit the board.md:

[29] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

✅ **Issue completed!**

I've successfully implemented the **Fix README description** task:

1. Changed "A sample project." to "A sample project for demonstration." in README.md
2. Committed the change
3. Updated board.md to move the issue from Ready to Done
4. Landed the changes on main

The P0 task is complete. The next task (P1: Improve main.py) is now ready under `# Ready` in the board.

Syncing brief and board...

**Current state:**
- Brief mentions two tasks: P0 (Fix README) and P1 (Improve main.py)
- Board shows P0 already in Done (recent commit "80c19bd Update board: move P0 to Done")
- P1 is in Ready status

**Sync analysis:**
Brief is stale for P0 — already completed. P1 is already on the board in Ready. No new entries needed.

**Task selection:**
P1 (Improve main.py) is Ready and the only actionable work. No blocked issues, no plan items pending review.

Excellent! I've successfully implemented the P1 task:

**What was done:**
- Wrapped the `print("hello")` statement in `src/main.py` with an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard
- This allows the file to be safely imported as a module without executing the print statement
- Updated the board to move P1 to Done
- Landed the changes on main

Both P0 and P1 tasks are now complete and landed.

**Sync Analysis:**

The brief contains two tasks:
- P0: Fix README description
- P1: Improve main.py

Both are already listed in the `# Done` section of the board. The brief is stale — these tasks were already completed in recent commits (6ae76ea and 2f9ef16).

**Board State:**
- `# Blocked`: empty
- `# Plan`: empty
- `# Ready`: empty
- `# Done`: both brief items already listed

No new work to sync. No actionable tasks remain.
