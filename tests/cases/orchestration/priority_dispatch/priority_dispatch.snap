I'll read the brief and board to sync and pick the next task.

I'll sync the brief items onto the board and pick the P0 task.

**Sync analysis:** The brief has two new items that haven't been addressed. I'll add them to the board below the divider since they're actionable.

Now let me read the README.md to see the current description:

[17] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[18] Thinking...
Now I'll create a commit and update the board:

[20] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

Now I'll land the changes:

[22] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh

[23] Thinking...
I need to commit the board.md changes first:

[24] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[25] Thinking...
Now I'll land the changes:
