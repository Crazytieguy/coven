**Synced:** Added both brief items to the board.

**Task selection:** Picking **P0: Fix README description** as it's the highest priority and ready to implement. No open questions on the board, so no throttling applies.

Perfect! The review shows the README change is correct:
- Changed "A sample project." to "A sample project for demonstration." ✓

This meets the acceptance criteria. Now I'll move the issue to Done and land the changes.

Reading the brief and board...

**Sync Analysis:**
- Brief P0 "Fix README description" → already in Done ✓
- Brief P1 "Improve main.py" → already on board below divider ✓

The board is already in sync. No new entries to add.

**Task Selection:**
There's one actionable item below the divider:
- **P1: Improve main.py** — ready to implement

No other workers are active, and there are no open questions blocking work.

This is straightforward. I'll wrap the print statement in the standard Python guard.

I'll read both files to understand the current state and sync any work.

**Sync Analysis:**

Looking at the brief and board:
- **brief.md** lists: P0 (Fix README description) and P1 (Improve main.py)
- **board.md** shows both items already completed in the Done section

All work from the brief is already done. There are no new items to sync, no open questions, and no actionable work below the divider.

**Result:** No work to pick. Sleeping.
