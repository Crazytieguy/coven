## Current Queue

I found two approved issues:

1. **fix-readme.md** - P0 (Critical) - Fix README description
2. **improve-main.py** - P1 (Normal) - Improve main.py

## Dispatch Decision

Since both issues are already approved and ready for implementation, I'll dispatch the P0 issue first (critical priority). After this is complete, the improve-main.py issue will be next in the queue.

issue: issues/fix-readme.md

Now let me check if there are tests or a linter to run:

[21] ▶ Bash  ls -la /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/...
[22] Thinking...
The project appears to be a simple sample project with no tests or linter configuration. I'll now delete the issue file and commit the changes:

[23] ▶ Bash  rm /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[24] Thinking...
[25] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[26] Thinking...
Perfect! I've successfully completed the implementation:

1. ✅ Read the issue file with the plan
2. ✅ Updated `README.md` changing "A sample project." to "A sample project for demonstration."
3. ✅ Verified no tests or linter configuration needed for this project
4. ✅ Deleted the issue file
5. ✅ Committed the changes with a descriptive message

The issue is now resolved and the change has been committed to the repository.

## Reasoning

I found one issue in the queue:
- **improve-main.md** (P1, approved)

This issue is in the `approved` state, meaning it has a plan and is ready for implementation. The task is straightforward: wrap the print statement in src/main.py in an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard.

Since there are no other issues to plan and this approved work is ready, I'll dispatch it to the implement agent.

<dispatch>
agent: implement
issue: issues/improve-main.md
</dispatch>

Let me verify the change is correct and then commit it. Since there are no tests or linter configs in this minimal project, I'll proceed with the commit:

[61] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...

[64] Thinking...
✅ Implementation complete! I've successfully:

1. **Wrapped the print statement** in `src/main.py` with an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard
2. **Committed the changes** with a descriptive message
3. **Deleted the issue file** and committed the removal

The code now follows Python best practices by ensuring it only runs when executed directly, not when imported as a module.
