**Dispatch Decision:**

I found two approved issues ready for implementation:
- `fix-readme.md` (P0) - Update README description  
- `improve-main.py` (P1) - Add `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard

Since both are in `approved` state and no other workers are active, I'll route to the implement agent starting with the P0 issue.

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the plan:

1. ✅ Read the issue file — it specified changing "A sample project." to "A sample project for demonstration." in README.md
2. ✅ Implemented the change in README.md
3. ✅ No tests or linting configuration found (simple project)
4. ✅ Deleted the issue file
5. ✅ Committed all changes with a descriptive message

The implementation is complete and ready to be landed.

The changes look good. There's one commit that fixes the README description and deletes the resolved issue file. This is a complete implementation of an approved issue. Let me run the land script to rebase and merge onto main.

## Analysis

**Worktree state**: Clean and up to date (just landed the fix-readme issue)

**Issues**:
- `issues/improve-main.md` — P1, **approved** — Wrap print statement in src/main.py with `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard

**Reasoning**: The only available issue is in the `approved` state with a plan already written. No review queue buildup, no conflicting work. This is ready to implement immediately.

I'll review the current branch's changes and land them on main. Let me start by examining the commits and diff.

[61] ▶ Bash  git log --oneline main..HEAD
[62] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[63] Thinking...
The changes look good. There's one commit that wraps the print statement in a main guard and deletes the completed issue. Now I'll run the land script to rebase and fast-forward main.

[64] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[65] Thinking...
Perfect! The changes have been successfully landed on main. The commit that wraps the print statement in a main guard has been applied, and the completed issue has been deleted.

**Reasoning:**

- **Worktree state:** Clean and in sync with main (no uncommitted changes, no commits ahead)
- **Issues:** No issues exist in `issues/` or `review/` directories
- **Action:** Nothing to plan or implement right now

Since the repository has been initialized and the worktree is clean with no work items, I'll sleep and wait for new issues to be created.
