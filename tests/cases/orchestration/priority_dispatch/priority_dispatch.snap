## Analysis

**Worktree state:** Clean, no commits ahead of main.

**Available issues:**
- `issues/fix-readme.md` — P0, approved
- `issues/improve-main.md` — P1, approved

Both issues are in the `approved` state, meaning they're ready for implementation. Since there are no `new`, `changes-requested`, or `needs-replan` issues to plan, and no `review` items needing human attention, the best use of this worker is to start implementing. I'll pick the highest priority issue first.

I'll help you implement the plan in the issue. Let me start by reading the issue file.

[7] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-priority_dispatch-worker-worktrees/coven-vcr-prior...
[8] Thinking...
Now let me read the README.md file to see what needs to be changed.

[9] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-priority_dispatch-worker-worktrees/coven-vcr-prior...
[10] Thinking...
I'll make the requested change to the README.md file.

[11] ▶ Edit  /tmp/coven-vcr-priority_dispatch-worker-worktrees/coven-vcr-prio...
[12] Thinking...
Now let me check if there are any tests or linter scripts to run.

[14] Thinking...
[15] ▶ Bash  ls -la /tmp/coven-vcr-priority_dispatch-worker-worktrees/coven-v...
[16] Thinking...
Now I'll delete the issue file and commit the changes.

[17] ▶ Bash  rm /tmp/coven-vcr-priority_dispatch-worker-worktrees/coven-vcr-p...
[18] Thinking...
Now let me commit the changes.

[21] ▶ Bash  cd /tmp/coven-vcr-priority_dispatch-worker-worktrees/coven-vcr-p...
[22] Thinking...
Perfect! The changes have been implemented and committed. The issue has been deleted, and I've successfully updated the README.md with the requested description change. Now I'll hand off to the land agent to audit and land the changes on main.

I'll review the changes on this branch and land them on main. Let me start by examining what commits need to be landed.

[24] ▶ Bash  git log --oneline main..HEAD
[25] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD

     ✗ Sibling tool call errored
[26] Thinking...
Let me check the current git status and branches:

[27] ▶ Bash  git branch -a && git status
[28] Thinking...
I see the main branch is `master`, not `main`. Let me check the commits and diff:

[29] ▶ Bash  git log --oneline master..HEAD
[30] ▶ Bash  git diff master...HEAD
[31] Thinking...
Perfect! There's one commit to land that:
- Updates the README description 
- Deletes the completed issue file

The changes look good and match the expected implementation. Now let me run the landing script:

[32] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[33] Thinking...
Excellent! The changes have been successfully landed on master. The commit "Fix README description" is now part of the main branch, with the README updated and the completed issue file removed.

## Summary

**Issues found:**
- `improve-main.md` (P1, approved) — ready to implement

**Worktree state:**
- Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- Not ahead of master

**Routing decision:**
The `improve-main.md` issue is in `approved` state, so it's ready for implementation. I'll route to the implement agent.

<next>
agent: implement
issue: issues/improve-main.md

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the plan:

1. ✅ Wrapped the print statement in `src/main.py` with a `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard
2. ✅ No tests or linter configurations to run in this project
3. ✅ Deleted the issue file
4. ✅ Committed the changes with a descriptive message

Good! I can see one commit to land: "Wrap print statement in if __name__ == "__main__" guard". The changes are:
- Modified `src/main.py` to wrap the print statement in an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard
- Deleted the corresponding issue file after completion

The changes look good. Now let me run the landing script to rebase and fast-forward onto master.

[71] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh

Perfect! The changes have been successfully landed on master. The commit has been fast-forwarded and the issue has been completed.

I'll check the current issues to determine what work needs to be done.

[74] ▶ Bash  head -7 issues/*.md review/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
[75] Thinking...
Let me check the worktree state to see if there's any pending work:

[76] ▶ Bash  git status
[77] Thinking...
**Reasoning:**

- **Issues check**: No issues found in `issues/` or `review/` directories
- **Worktree state**: Clean, no uncommitted changes or divergence from main
- **Available work**: Nothing to plan, implement, or land

Since there are no issues to work on and the worktree is clean, I'll transition to sleep and wait for new work.

sleep: true
