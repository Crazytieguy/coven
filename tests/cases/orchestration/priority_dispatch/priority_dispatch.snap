## Summary

I found 2 approved issues ready for implementation:
- **fix-readme.md** (P0): Change README description
- **improve-main.py** (P1): Add `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard

Both are in `approved` state, so they're ready for the `implement` agent. I'll route the higher priority P0 issue first.

I'll start by reading the issue file to understand what needs to be implemented.

Since this is a simple project without tests or linters configured, I'll now clean up by deleting the issue file and committing the changes.

[24] Thinking...
Done! I've successfully completed the implementation:

1. ✓ Updated README.md to change "A sample project." to "A sample project for demonstration."
2. ✓ Verified no tests or linters are configured in this project
3. ✓ Deleted the issue file
4. ✓ Committed the changes with commit `695fa0c`

The task is complete!

**Analysis:**

I found one issue:
- `issues/improve-main.md` — Priority: P1, State: **approved**

**Routing decision:**

The issue is in `approved` state, which means the plan has been reviewed and it's ready for implementation. According to the workflow, `approved` issues route to the `implement` agent.

Done! I've successfully implemented the plan from `issues/improve-main.md`:

**Changes made:**
- Wrapped the `print("hello")` statement in `src/main.py` with an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard

**Verification:**
- No tests or linting configuration files found in the project, so no additional checks were needed
- Deleted the completed issue file
- Committed changes with descriptive messages

The working tree is now clean and the task is complete.

**Reasoning:**

I checked both the `issues/` and `review/` directories and found no outstanding issues. With no new issues to plan and no approved issues to implement, there is no actionable work available.
