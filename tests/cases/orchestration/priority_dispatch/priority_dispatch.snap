I'll help you work on the board issue. Let me start by reading the board and any existing context.

[32] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

     ✗ Error: File does not exist.
[34] Thinking...
Now let me read the main.py file to see what needs to be changed.

[35] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[36] Thinking...
Perfect! The task is clear. I need to wrap the print statement in an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard. Let me make that change.

[37] ▶ Edit  (+1)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...
[38] Thinking...
Now let me update the board to move this task to Done, and then commit and land the changes.

[39] ▶ Edit  (-3)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...
[40] Thinking...
Now let me commit and land these changes.

[41] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[42] Thinking...
[43] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[44] Thinking...
Done! I've successfully completed the task:

✅ Wrapped the print statement in `src/main.py` with an `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard  
✅ Updated the board to move the issue to Done  
✅ Committed and landed the changes

The changes are now on main and ready for the next task.

I'll read the brief and board to sync work and pick the next task.

The brief contains two tasks, both of which are already completed and marked in the Done section:

- **P0: Fix README description** — already done (commit 49b735c)
- **P1: Improve main.py** — already done (commit 4b69a1c)

The board is current and accurate. No new work to sync. With no items under `# Ready`, there's nothing actionable to pick up.
