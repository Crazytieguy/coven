[7] Thinking...
I'll sync the new work onto the board and then pick a task.

**Current state:**
- **brief.md** has 2 tasks: Add project description to README and add status badge to README
- **board.md** is empty (just has the divider)

**Sync:**

I'll add both tasks to the board below the divider since they're ready to implement.

[8] ▶ Edit  (+8)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/co...

**Reasoning:**

✓ Synced 2 new tasks to the board from brief.md
✓ No open questions, so no throttling needed
✓ Both tasks are P1 ready-to-implement items

**Task selection:** Picking **P1: Add project description to README** (first of two equally-prioritized tasks)

I've read both files. Here's the analysis:

**Sync Status:** ✅ No changes needed
- Brief task "Add project description to README" → Already in Done ✓
- Brief task "Add status badge to README" → Already on board as P1 ✓

**Board State:**
- 0 open questions (no issues above the divider)
- 1 actionable P1 issue: "Add status badge to README"

**Task Selection:**
Picking **P1: Add status badge to README** — it's the only ready work and highest priority.
