I'll help you work on adding a project description to README.md. Let me start by reading the board and understanding the current state.

[12] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

     ✗ Error: File does not exist.
[14] Thinking...
Now let me read the current README.md to see what we're working with:

[15] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[16] Thinking...
Perfect! I can see the README currently has "A sample project for testing." The task is to add a more descriptive project description. Let me implement this by replacing the existing description with something like the suggested example:

[17] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[18] Thinking...
Now let me create a scratch.md file to record what was done, then commit the changes:

[19] ▶ Write  (10 lines)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w000...
[20] Thinking...
Let me commit this change:

[21] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[22] Thinking...
Now let me update board.md to move the completed issue to the Done section:

[23] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[24] Thinking...
Let me commit the board update:

[25] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git commit -m "Mark 'Add project description...
[26] Thinking...
Now let me delete scratch.md and land the changes:

[27] ▶ Bash  rm /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[28] Thinking...
Perfect! I've successfully completed the task:

✅ **Added project description to README.md** - Updated the description from "A sample project for testing." to "A modern toolkit for building great software." right after the title line.

The changes have been committed and landed on main. Ready for the next task!

Synced brief to board. Resolved merge conflict where another worker (clever-ember-75) already added the first task. Now ready for work.

**Reasoning:** Two P1 tasks synced. One is in progress with another worker. One actionable task below divider: "Add status badge to README". No blocked issues waiting on human input. Picking the ready task.
