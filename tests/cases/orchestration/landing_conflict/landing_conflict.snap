However, the worker status shows sharp-raven-72 is already implementing this exact issue. Per the dispatch preferences: "Don't assign work another worker is already doing."

There are no new, changes-requested, or needs-replan issues to plan. The review queue is empty. The worktree is clean and up-to-date with main.

Since there's no available work to assign, I'll sleep and wait for new commits.

## Analysis

**Worktree State**: Clean, not ahead of master

**Available Issues**:
- `issues/rename-project.md` - state: approved, P1 (swift-wave-12 already implementing)
- `issues/update-title-v2.md` - state: approved, P1 (available)

**Decision**: Route to implement agent for `update-title-v2.md` since it's approved and ready, and the other worker is already handling the first issue.

## Summary

I've detected a fundamental conflict during landing that prevents the changes from being integrated with master.

**Issue**: The `update-title-v2` issue attempted to update the README title from "# My Project" to "# My Project v2". However, master branch has since been updated with commits that renamed the project to "# Sample App" instead, creating conflicting changes to the same file.

**Action taken**:
- Aborted the rebase to prevent incomplete merge
- Restored the issue file and marked it as `needs-replan` with detailed notes about the conflict
- Added explanation that clarification is needed on the intended project title

**Next steps**: The issue now requires human review to determine:
1. Whether "Sample App" should be kept (abandoning the v2 update)
2. Whether it should be "Sample App v2" instead
3. Whether "My Project v2" is still desired and master's rename should be reverted

Handing off to dispatch agent for next workflow step.

I'll check the current issues to determine what work needs to be done.

[75] ▶ Bash  head -7 issues/*.md review/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
[76] Thinking...
**Current Issues:**
- `rename-project.md` (P1, approved) - ready to implement
- `update-title-v2.md` (P1, needs-replan) - needs plan revision

**Reasoning:**
The `update-title-v2` issue has `needs-replan` status, meaning the previous implementation failed and requires plan revision. Following the dispatch preference to prioritize planning work, I'll route to the plan agent to revise this plan before moving to implementation of the approved issue.

[77] Thinking...
I'll help you write an implementation plan for the issue. Let me start by reading the issue file and exploring the codebase.

[78] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-landing_conflict-worker_b-worktrees/coven-vcr-lan...
[79] ▶ Glob  **/*.{md,json,html,tsx,ts,js}

[89] Thinking...
[90] ▶ Bash  git log master --oneline -10
[91] Thinking...
[92] ▶ Bash  git show master:README.md
[93] Thinking...
Now I understand the situation. Let me update the plan based on the current state:

The README currently shows "# My Project v2" in the working directory, but master has "# Sample App" (from the completed rename-project issue). Since this is marked as `needs-replan` due to conflicts, I need to provide a revised plan that addresses the ambiguity.

[94] ▶ Edit  (+10)  /tmp/coven-vcr-landing_conflict-worker_b-worktrees/coven-...
[95] Thinking...
[96] ▶ Edit  /tmp/coven-vcr-landing_conflict-worker_b-worktrees/coven-vcr-lan...

[103] Thinking...
[104] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-landing_conflict-worker_b-worktrees/coven-vcr-la...
[105] Thinking...
The land.sh script rebases the current branch onto master and then fast-forwards master to the new state. Since my changes are just the plan update (moving the issue file to review/ and updating its content), and these don't conflict with anything on master, the rebase should succeed cleanly.

Let me run it:

[106] ▶ Bash  bash /tmp/coven-vcr-landing_conflict-worker_b-worktrees/coven-v...
      ✗ Error: This command requires approval
[107] Thinking...
I've successfully created the revised plan for the update-title-v2 issue. Here's what I've done:

**Plan Summary:**
- Identified the conflict between this issue and the rename-project issue already on master
- Revised the plan to surface the ambiguity clearly with three implementation options
- Added a **Questions** section asking for clarification on the final title

**Status:**
- Updated frontmatter to `state: review`
- Moved the file from `issues/` to `review/`
- Committed the plan: "Replan update-title-v2: resolve conflict with rename-project issue"
- The plan is now ready for human review in the review/ directory

**Next step requires approval:**
The final step (`bash .coven/land.sh`) requires permission to rebase and merge changes to the master branch. This script will land the plan commit onto master. The rebase should be clean since the plan file changes don't conflict with anything on master.

Once you approve the landing step, the plan will be ready for a human reviewer to clarify which title should be the final state before implementation can proceed.

[142] ▶ Bash  git log --oneline master..HEAD
[143] ▶ Bash  git diff master...HEAD
[144] Thinking...
Perfect! The changes look good. We have:
- Updated README.md to "Sample App" (from the rename-project issue)
- Closed the rename-project issue
- Moved the conflicting update-title-v2 issue to review status with clarification questions

Now let me run the landing script:

[145] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
      ✗ Error: Exit code 1
[146] Thinking...
We have a conflict in README.md. Let me check and resolve it:

[154] Thinking...
I see the issue now. Both our branch and master have "Rename project in README" commits, causing a conflict. Master already completed this work. Let me resolve this by accepting master's state ("Sample App") and continuing the rebase:

[155] ▶ Edit  (-4)  /tmp/coven-vcr-landing_conflict-worker_b-worktrees/coven-...

[166] ▶ Bash  git add README.md && git rebase --continue
[167] Thinking...
Excellent! The rebase succeeded and Git automatically dropped the duplicate "Rename project in README" commit. Now let me run the landing script to complete the process:

[168] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[169] Thinking...
Perfect! Successfully landed the changes on master. Here's what happened:

**Landing Summary:**
- Resolved conflict in README.md (kept "# Sample App" which was already on master)
- Automatically dropped the duplicate "Rename project in README" commit (Git detected it was already upstream)
- Successfully landed 3 commits:
  1. Closed the rename-project issue
  2. Moved update-title-v2 to review with clarification questions about the final title
  3. Related planning updates

The key conflict was that the rename-project work was already completed on master (changing "# My Project" to "# Sample App"), so our duplicate attempt to rename was dropped. The update-title-v2 issue is now in review pending clarification on whether the final title should be "Sample App v2", "My Project v2", or just "Sample App".

I'll check the current state of issues to determine what work should be done next.

Let me check the worktree status:

## Dispatch Analysis

**Issue Status:**
- `review/update-title-v2.md` (P1) - Plan is awaiting human review

**Worktree Status:**
- Clean (no uncommitted changes)
- Not ahead of master (d4768fd is on master)

**Reasoning:**
- No issues in `new`, `changes-requested`, `needs-replan`, or `approved` states
- The only issue is in `review/` awaiting human review - cannot assign per routing rules
- Nothing is plannable or implementable at this time

The worker should sleep and wait for either new issues or human review of the pending plan.
