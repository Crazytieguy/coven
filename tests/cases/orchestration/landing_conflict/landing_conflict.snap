I found two approved issues, both P1:
1. **rename-project.md** — Change README title to "# Sample App"
2. **update-title-v2.md** — Change README title to "# My Project v2"

Both are ready to implement. I'll route to the implement agent with the first issue. Note: these have conflicting changes to the same line, so only one can be implemented as-is.

Good, I can see there's one commit to land that renames the project in README. There's also an uncommitted deletion of the `rename-project.md` issue file. Let me commit that cleanup first, then land everything.

Excellent! The changes have been successfully landed on main. Here's what was merged:

✅ **Changes landed:**
- Renamed project in README.md from "My Project" to "Sample App"
- Removed the completed `rename-project.md` issue file

The 2 commits have been rebased and fast-forward merged onto main. All changes are now on the main branch.

**Reasoning:**
- Worktree is clean and up to date with main (just landed rename-project work)
- 1 approved issue: `update-title-v2.md` (P1) — ready for implementation

## Analysis

**Worktree state:** Clean and synced with main (both at commit 7945499)

**Issues:** No issues found in `issues/` or `review/` directories

**Status:** The keen-pulse-39 branch has been successfully landed. There are no outstanding tasks:
- No new issues requiring planning
- No approved issues ready for implementation  
- No pending reviews
- No uncommitted changes

**Decision:** With no plannable or implementable work available, this worker should sleep and wait for new commits on main.

## Analysis

The repository is in a clean state:
- **Issues directory**: Empty (all issues have been completed and removed)
- **Review directory**: Empty (no pending plans)
- **Worktree**: Just finished landing changes to main, so it's synchronized
- **No pending work**: No issues with states `new`, `changes-requested`, `needs-replan`, or `approved`

Since there are no plannable or implementable issues, the worker should sleep and wait for new issues to be created.
