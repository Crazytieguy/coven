Synced two tasks from brief. Both are P1 README updates:
1. Add status badge to README.md
2. Add project description to README.md

Picking the first: **Add status badge to README.md** — straightforward task with clear requirements.

- Status badge task: ✓ Done (already completed)
- Project description task: → Ready (no new work)

## Pick Task

Picking **P1: Add project description to README.md** — only actionable item in Ready.

I can see the task clearly. Let me check the current state:

The README.md already has:
1. Title: "# My Project"
2. Status badge (from the previous task)
3. A description: "A sample project for testing."

The task asks to "Add a project description to README.md right after the title line. Something like 'A modern toolkit for building great software.'"

There's some ambiguity here - a description already exists ("A sample project for testing."), so I need to clarify:

**Should I:**
1. Keep the existing description as-is (task already complete)?
2. Replace "A sample project for testing." with something like the example "A modern toolkit for building great software."?
3. Add an additional description line?

Let me post this to the board for guidance.

[40] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[41] Thinking...
Looking at the task and current README, I can see there's already a description ("A sample project for testing."), but it appears to be a placeholder. The task asks for something like "A modern toolkit for building great software." — a more substantive description.

I'll replace the current description with a more appropriate one. Since this is "My Project", I'll use a project description similar to the example style.

[42] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

Now I'll update the board to mark this task complete and commit the changes.

Looking at brief.md and board.md:

**Brief:** Two tasks
- Add project description to README.md
- Add status badge to README.md

**Board status:**
- Both items are already in `# Done` (though "status badge" oddly appears in both Ready and Done)
- Recent commits show both tasks were completed

The brief tasks have already been addressed. The board has stale entries — "Add status badge" shouldn't be in Ready if it's already done. Let me clean this up.
