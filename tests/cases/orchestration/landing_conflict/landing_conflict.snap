Let me check the current README to see where I need to add the description.

I can see the current README has "A sample project for testing." on line 3. I need to replace it with "A modern toolkit for building great software." according to the issue description.

Let me update the README:

**Sync Complete**

Board updated with 2 P1 tasks from brief:
1. Add project description to README
2. Add status badge to README

**Pick Task**

I'm picking the second task: **"Add status badge to README"**

**Reasoning:** Both tasks are P1 and ready to work on. However, bold-meteor-29 is already running the first task (Add project description to README), so I'm picking the status badge task to avoid duplicate work.
