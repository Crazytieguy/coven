**Sync complete.** I've created two board entries from the brief:
- P1: Add project description to README
- P1: Add status badge to README

Both tasks are ready to work on. Picking the first one.

I see there's a merge conflict. The main branch has combined both tasks into a single one. Let me resolve the conflict by keeping the main branch's version since it represents the current source of truth:

Perfect! I've successfully completed the task "Add project description to README":

**Summary of work:**
- Added the project description "A modern toolkit for building great software." to README.md immediately after the title
- Committed the changes with appropriate commit message
- Updated the board to mark this task as completed
- Resolved a merge conflict with main branch during rebase
- Landed changes to main branch

The README now has the project description properly positioned right after the title line.

Looking at the brief and board:

**Sync findings:**
- Brief has two items: add project description (done) + add status badge (needed)
- Board shows "P1: Update README with description and status badge" but it's positioned **above** the divider (blocked state)
- The description was already completed (commit 731e602) and marked done
- The status badge still needs to be added
- The board entry has no questions/blockers, so it should be **below** the divider

**Action:** I'll move the P1 task below the divider to make it ready to work on, since both tasks are actionable and unblocked. Then I'll transition to the main agent to complete it.

I'll sync the brief items to the board and pick a task.

**Current state:** brief.md has 2 new items, board.md is empty.
