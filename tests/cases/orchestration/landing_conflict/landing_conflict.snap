I'll start by reading the board to find the issue and understand what needs to be done.

[10] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[11] Thinking...
Now let me check if there's a scratch.md file with context from previous sessions:

[12] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
     ✗ Error: File does not exist.
[13] Thinking...
Now let me read the current README.md:

[14] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[15] Thinking...
Let me post to the board with a clarifying question, since the README already has a description and I want to make sure I understand what's being asked:

[16] ▶ Edit  (+3)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...
[17] Thinking...
Now let me commit this board update:

[18] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[19] Thinking...
Let me land this change:

There's a conflict in board.md. Let me read it to see what's happening:

[22] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[23] Thinking...
Let me resolve this conflict by using the main branch version and adding my clarifying question:

[24] ▶ Edit  (-9)  
     ✗ InputValidationError: [
[25] Thinking...
Let me try again with the file path:

[26] ▶ Edit  (-9)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...
[27] Thinking...
Now let me complete the rebase and land the changes:

[28] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git rebase --continue && bash .coven/land.sh...
     ✗ Error: Exit code 1
[29] Thinking...
Let me read the file again and resolve this conflict properly:

[30] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[31] Thinking...
Let me resolve this by merging everything into the combined entry:

[32] ▶ Edit  (-11)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/...
[33] Thinking...
Now let me complete the rebase:

[34] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git rebase --continue 2>&1
[35] Thinking...
Great! Now let me land these changes:

[36] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh 2>&1
[37] Thinking...
Perfect! I've posted a clarifying question on the board about how to handle the existing description in the README. The question is now live and waiting for your input.

I'll sync the brief and board, then pick the next task.

## Sync

The brief and board are in sync. The brief confirms the P1 task: update README.md with a project description and status badge.

## Status

The board has one P1 task below the divider:
- **P1: Update README.md with description and status badge** — currently being worked on by steady-wolf-58 (PID 21701)

Since the only actionable task is already in progress by another worker, there's nothing for me to pick.

1. Add a project description after the title
2. Add a status badge after the title

Perfect! I can see the task clearly. The README.md currently has a title and a simple description. I need to:
1. Add a status badge after the title
2. Add a project description after the title

Let me update the README.md:

Excellent! I've successfully completed the task:
