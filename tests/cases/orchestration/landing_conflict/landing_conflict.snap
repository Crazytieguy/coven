I'll plan this board issue. Let me start by exploring the current state.

[20] Thinking...
Based on my exploration, I can see the README.md currently has:
- Title on line 1
- Blank line on line 2
- Description on line 3

I see two P1 issues queued:
1. Add a project description right after the title
2. Add a status badge right after the title

Let me post the plan to the board:

[21] ▶ Edit  (+7)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...
[22] Thinking...
Now let me commit and land this change:

[23] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[24] Thinking...
[25] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[26] Thinking...
Plan complete. I've identified the key decision (description on line 2, replacing the existing description) and surfaced the critical question about the ordering with the status badge issue that also specifies "right after the title line."

The issue has been moved to `# Blocked` waiting for human input on how to handle the two P1 issues that both want the same real estate in the README.

I'll read the brief and board to sync work and pick a task.

[30] Thinking...
Looking at the sync:

**Brief items:**
- Add project description to README.md
- Add status badge to README.md

**Board status:**
Both tasks are under `# Blocked` because of an unresolved ordering question: "should the description and badge both exist, and if so, what order?"

The brief requests both items "right after the title line" but doesn't explicitly specify the order when they both exist. The board correctly identified this as needing clarification.

Since all actionable work is blocked and the brief doesn't resolve the ordering question, I have nothing to pick.

I can see that another worker (blazing-cedar-75) is already planning the first README task. I'll sync the second task and pick it up.

There's a conflict because the other worker already added the first README task to the board. Let me resolve this by keeping both entries:

The board shows both tasks are blocked with an open question about ordering. Let me fix the board formatting (there's a duplicate "# Blocked" header) and then sleep since there's no actionable work:

Both tasks are blocked waiting for clarification on the order of the description and badge lines. No actionable work remains.
