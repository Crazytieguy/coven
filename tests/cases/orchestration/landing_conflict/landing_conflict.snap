I've synced the brief items onto the board. Two new P1 tasks:
1. Add project description to README.md
2. Add status badge to README.md

Both are ready to implement with no open questions. I'll pick the first one (project description) since it makes logical sense to add the description first, then the badge below it.

I'll help you work on the board issue. Let me start by reading the board and checking for any previous session context.

[15] Thinking...
Now let me check the current README.md to see its structure:

[16] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[17] Thinking...
Let me check the brief.md for more context on this task:

[18] ▶ Bash  cat /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cov...
[19] Thinking...
I can see the task clearly. The README currently has a placeholder description "A sample project for testing." and I need to update it to a proper project description like the example given.

Let me update the README with a professional project description right after the title:

[20] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[21] Thinking...
Let me verify the change:

[22] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[23] Thinking...
Perfect! Now let me commit this change:

[24] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[25] Thinking...
Now let me do a quick review of the changes:

[26] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[27] Thinking...
Excellent! The review passes. The change is exactly what was requested:
- ✓ Project description added to README
- ✓ Positioned right after the title line
- ✓ Updated to the professional tagline suggested

Now let me move this task to the Done section and complete the workflow:

[28] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

Now let me commit the board update:

[31] Thinking...
Now let me land the changes:

[32] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[33] Thinking...
Perfect! Now let me clean up by removing scratch.md if it exists, and then transition to dispatch:

[34] ▶ Bash  rm -f scratch.md && git status
[35] Thinking...
Excellent! The task is complete. I've successfully:

1. ✅ Updated the README.md with the professional project description "A modern toolkit for building great software."
2. ✅ Verified the changes match the acceptance criteria
3. ✅ Committed all work
4. ✅ Landed the changes back to main
5. ✅ Cleaned up scratch.md

The worktree is clean and ready to transition to the next task.

Perfect! Let me analyze the current state:

**Brief items:**
1. ✅ Add project description to README.md - already completed (in Done)
2. ⚙️ Add status badge to README.md - on board, ready to implement

**Board status:**
- No open questions above the divider
- One ready-to-implement task below the divider: "P1: Add status badge to README.md"

**Sync:** The board is already in sync with the brief. Both tasks are accounted for.

**Task selection:** I'll pick **"Add status badge to README.md"** (P1) as the next task. It's the only ready-to-implement item and has no blocking questions.
