## Sync Complete & Task Selection

**Board updated:** I've synced 2 tasks from the brief onto the board, both P1 priority and ready to implement:
- Add status badge to README
- Add project description to README

**Picked task:** "Add status badge to README" (first P1 item below the divider)

**Reasoning:** Both items are P1 and actionable. There are no open questions throttling work. I'll pick the first one to make incremental progress on README improvements.

I've completed the implementation of the status badge task:

**What I did:**
- Added the status badge line `![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-green)` right after the title in README.md
- Committed the change

The badge is now positioned correctly between the title and the description. The next step is a review session where I'll verify the change and land it.

- ✓ Badge added on line 3 right after the title
- ✓ Correct badge URL: `![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-green)`
- ✓ Proper formatting with blank line separation

Now I'll complete the workflow by moving the entry to Done in board.md and landing the changes.

## Sync Analysis

**Brief items vs Board:**
- ✅ "Add a project description to README.md" → already on board as P1 (ready to implement)
- ✅ "Add a status badge line to README.md" → already in Done section

No new items to add. Board is current.

## Task Selection

Picking **P1: Add project description to README** (the only ready task below the divider).

No open questions above the divider, so I can proceed immediately. This is a straightforward implementation task.

Now let me commit the board update:

[84] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

Now let me land these changes:

[86] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[87] Thinking...
Perfect! The work is complete. I've successfully:

1. ✅ Added a project description ("A modern toolkit for building great software.") right after the title in README.md
2. ✅ Committed the change
3. ✅ Marked the issue as done on the board
4. ✅ Landed the changes to main

I'll read the brief and board to understand the current state.

**Status:** Both brief items are already completed and marked in the Done section of the board.

**Analysis:**
- Brief requires: Add project description + Add status badge to README
- Board shows: Both items are in the Done section
- No new items to sync
- No open questions to throttle on
- No actionable items below the divider

Since all work is complete and there are no actionable tasks, I'll sleep.
