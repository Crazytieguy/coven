## Done! ✅

I've successfully completed the "Add status badge to README.md" task:

1. **Added the badge**: The status badge `![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-green)` is now on line 2, right after the title
2. **Verified**: The diff shows the change is exactly as specified
3. **Landed**: Changes have been rebased onto main and committed

The task is now in the Done section of the board.

4. ✅ Resolved a merge conflict and landed the changes
5. ✅ Cleaned up scratch.md

The README now has a proper project description between the title and status badge, exactly as specified in the issue.
