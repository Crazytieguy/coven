## Sync Complete

I've synced the brief with the board:

**New entries created:**
- P1: Add status badge to README.md
- P1: Update project description in README.md

Both items from the brief have been added below the divider as they're ready to implement. No open questions exist.

## Task Selection

**Reasoning:** There are 2 actionable P1 tasks with no blocking questions. I'll pick the first task to implement.

## Analysis

**Brief items:**
1. Add project description "A modern toolkit for building great software." ✓ Already on board as P1
2. Add status badge ✓ Already completed (commit 9d3fceb)

**Board state:**
- 0 items waiting for answers (no questions)
- 1 item below divider (P1): Update project description

**Current README:**
- Has title ✓
- Has status badge ✓
- Has old description ("A sample project for testing") - needs updating

## Sync

The board is already synced with the brief. The status badge was completed and properly removed. The description update is queued as P1.

## Pick a Task

Selecting **P1: Update project description in README.md** - it's the only actionable item, there are no throttling questions, and it's high priority.

## Analysis

**Brief items:** Both completed
- ✅ Status badge added to README.md (line 3)
- ✅ Project description added to README.md (line 5)

**Board state:** Empty with no open questions

**Git history:** Recent commits show these items were implemented and board entries were cleaned up (e63e3a0, 764736c)

**Conclusion:** All work from the brief is complete and already implemented. The board has no actionable items and there are no open questions. Nothing to do.

Perfect! I've synced the board successfully. Here's what I found:

**Sync Results:**
- Two tasks from the brief are already on the main board (added by another worker):
  1. Add status badge to README.md
  2. Update project description in README.md
- Both are P1 priority and below the divider, so they're ready to implement

**Board Status:**
- 0 open questions above the divider
- 2 ready tasks below the divider (both P1)
- No other workers actively on these tasks

**Picking a task:**
I'll select **"Add status badge to README.md"** to work on. It's the first task, straightforward to implement, and has a clear acceptance criteria.
