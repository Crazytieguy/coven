I'll read the brief and board to understand the current state.

I'll sync the brief items to the board and pick a task.

**Sync:** The brief has 2 new items about updating README.md. Both are straightforward tasks with no blocking questions. I'll add them as P1 entries below the divider since they're actionable.

**Pick:** I'll pick the first task to update README.md with both changes (status badge and description). This is a single file update that can be done in one task.

I'll start by reading the board to understand the issue.

Now let me read the current README.md to see what we're working with:

[14] Thinking...
Perfect! The task is clear. I need to add a status badge and update the description in README.md. Let me implement this:

[15] ▶ Edit  (+2)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...
[16] Thinking...
Let me verify the update looks correct:

[18] Thinking...
Perfect! Now I'll commit this change and update the board:

[19] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...

[24] Thinking...
Now I'll land the changes:

[25] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh

[26] Thinking...
I need to resolve the board.md conflict. Since I've already completed the task, I'll keep my version which marks it as done:

[27] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[28] Thinking...
I'll resolve this by keeping my version which shows the task as completed:

     ✗ Error: String to replace not found in file.

Let me write the resolved version directly:

[32] Thinking...
Now complete the rebase:

[33] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git rebase --continue
[34] Thinking...
Now run the land script again:

[35] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[36] Thinking...
Perfect! The changes have been landed. Let me verify the final state and transition to dispatch:

[37] ▶ Bash  git log --oneline -5
[38] Thinking...
Excellent! The task is complete. The README.md has been updated with the status badge and new description, and all changes have been landed on main.

- The project description: "A modern toolkit for building great software."
