[1] Thinking...
I'll read the brief and board files to understand the current state of work.

[2] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...

[4] Thinking...
Let me check the recent git history to see if this work has already been started:

[5] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven...
[6] Thinking...
Now I'll sync the brief to the board. The brief item "Add a caching layer to the application" is not on the board and hasn't been recently worked on, so I need to add it:

[7] ▶ Edit  (+8)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/co...
[8] Thinking...
Now I'll commit the board changes:

[9] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven...
[10] Thinking...
Now I'll run the land script:

[11] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh

Let me check the current board state:

## Analysis

**Sync Summary:**
- Added 1 new board entry from brief: "P1: Add a caching layer to the application"
- Committed and landed the changes

**Current Board State:**
- 1 P1 issue with open questions (above divider)
- 0 ready tasks (below divider)

**Reasoning:**
The caching layer task is not actionable yet—it has open questions about the implementation approach (caching type and scope). According to the throttling rules, P1 tasks can be picked if 6 or fewer issues are waiting for answers (we have 1), but this particular task needs clarification before work can begin.

<wait-for-user>
The brief mentions adding a caching layer for performance concerns, but doesn't specify implementation details. I need clarification on:
1. What type of caching should be used? (in-memory, Redis, file-based, etc.)
2. Which parts of the application should be cached?

Once you provide these details, I can move the task to ready status and begin implementation.
