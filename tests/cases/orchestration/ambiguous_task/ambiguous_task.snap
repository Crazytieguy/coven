I'll read the brief and board to understand the current work state.

Now I'll sync the brief to the board. The brief has one task that's not yet on the board, so I'll add it.

Done! I've synced the brief to the board by adding the caching layer task as a P1 item and landed the changes.

**Current state:**
- 1 task on board (below divider, ready to implement)
- 0 open questions
- No throttling needed

**Picking:** P1: Add a caching layer to the application — it's the only task ready, straightforward to implement.

I'll start by reading the board and scratch files to understand the current state of the caching layer task.

This is the first session on this task. Let me explore the codebase to understand the application and identify where a caching layer would be beneficial.

I need to stop here because the task is ambiguous. The brief says "Add a caching layer to the application," but there's no application code in this repo—only configuration files. Additionally, the brief doesn't specify:

- What type of application this is
- What performance concerns exist
- What caching strategy should be used (in-memory, Redis, HTTP caching, etc.)
- What specific operations need caching

Let me update the board with these questions:

I'll read the brief and board to understand the current state and sync any new work.

I've reviewed the brief and board. Here's the status:

**Sync Status:** The brief contains one task "Add a caching layer to the application" which is already on the board as P1 with open questions. No new work to sync.

**Task Selection:** The only P1 issue has 5 unanswered questions:
- What type of application is this?
- Where is the application code?
- What specific performance bottlenecks exist?
- What caching strategy is preferred?
- What should be cached and for how long?

Since this issue is above the divider (needs human input) and there are no ready tasks below the divider, there's no actionable work to pick.

**Reasoning:** The task cannot proceed without answers to the clarification questions. These questions are necessary to scope the implementation properly.
