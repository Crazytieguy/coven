## Summary

**Synced work:** Added the caching layer task from brief.md to board.md as a P1 issue with clarifying questions.

**Current state:**
- 1 P1 issue above the divider (needs human input)
- 0 issues ready to implement below the divider

**Reasoning:** The only task on the board has open questions that need clarification before implementation can begin. There's no actionable work ready to pick right now.
