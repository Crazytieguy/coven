## Sync Summary

✅ **Synced brief to board:**
- Created new P1 entry: "Add a caching layer to the application"
- Added open questions about caching strategy and what data to cache
- Committed and landed to main

## Pick a Task

**Status:** No actionable work available.

The only task on the board (P1: Add caching layer) has open questions and is above the divider. It needs clarification from you on:
- **Caching strategy**: In-memory, Redis, HTTP caching, or something else?
- **What to cache**: API responses, database queries, computed results, or a combination?

Once these are answered, I can move the issue below the divider and start implementation.
