I'll start by reading the board and checking for any previous session context.

No previous context exists. Let me explore the codebase to understand the application structure.

I can see the application is a simple Python script that converts text to uppercase. The caching requirement is quite ambiguous. Let me add clarifying questions to the board.

[29] Thinking...
I've identified ambiguities in the caching requirement and added clarifying questions to the board. The current application is a simple text-to-uppercase converter, and without more specifics about the caching strategy, backend, and performance targets, I can't proceed with a solid implementation.

## Analysis

**Brief:** One item requesting a caching layer for performance.

**Board:** Already has the P1 caching layer issue with 6 open questions (above divider).

**Sync:** No new items to add — brief matches the board.

**Actionability:** The only issue is above the divider with unanswered questions. There are no ready tasks below the divider to pick.

**Decision:** Nothing is actionable. Sleep.
