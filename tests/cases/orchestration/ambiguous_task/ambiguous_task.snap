I'll sync the brief to the board and pick a task.

**Synced.** One P1 task in brief: "Add a caching layer to the application". No blocked issues. Picking it now.

I'll read the test to understand the usage pattern better:

[19] Thinking...
Let me check the brief for any additional context:

[20] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[21] Thinking...
I see the task is ambiguous. Let me post to the board with questions to clarify before implementing.

[22] ▶ Edit  (+9)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...
[23] Thinking...
Now let me commit and land this:

[24] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[25] Thinking...
[26] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[27] Thinking...
I've identified the task as ambiguous and posted clarification questions to the board. The application is a simple CLI tool that converts input to uppercase, and without more context about the performance concern or caching strategy, I can't determine the right implementation approach.

I'll read the brief and board to understand the current state.

**Status:** The board already has the caching layer task with clarification questions posted. The brief doesn't contain answers to those questions yet, so the task remains blocked above the divider.

**Reasoning:** With one P1 issue blocked on human input and no work below the divider, there's nothing actionable to work on. I'll sleep and wait for the human to respond to the questions on the board.

sleep: true
