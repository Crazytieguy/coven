**Sync complete.** I've created a board entry for the caching layer task from the brief. No recent work to check against (only init commits).

**Task selected:** P1: Add caching layer to application

**Reasoning:** One actionable P1 task is ready. No open questions to throttle lower-priority work. Moving to implementation.

task: Add caching layer to application

I'll help you work on the "Add caching layer to application" issue. Let me start by reviewing the board and any previous session notes.

I can see this is a simple Python application with a `process()` function that converts text to uppercase. However, the task to "add a caching layer" is ambiguous given the current code:

**Questions:**
- **What should be cached?** The current `process()` function is just a string transformation with no expensive operations. Should we cache based on input strings?
- **What's the expected caching mechanism?** (e.g., in-memory cache, decorator-based, external service like Redis)
- **What's the use case?** Are there repeated calls with the same input that would benefit from caching? Should this be demonstrated in tests?

Let me update the board to surface these questions for clarification.

I've identified that the task requires clarification before implementation. The current application is simple—just converting text to uppercase—and the caching requirements aren't clear.

I've added questions to the board about:
- What should be cached (the `process()` function results?)
- Which caching mechanism to use
- The use case that demonstrates the performance benefit

Committing this and transitioning to dispatch for human input.

## Sync Status

Checked brief against board and recent commits:

- **Brief item**: "Add a caching layer to the application"
- **Board status**: Already has P1 entry with 3 open questions (above divider)
- **Recent commits**: The task was synced to the board, then clarifying questions were added
- **New work to sync**: None - brief item already on board

## Analysis

The board has:
- 1 item **above the divider** with open questions (not actionable)
- 0 items **below the divider** (no actionable work)

The questions blocking this task are:
1. What should be cached?
2. What caching mechanism?
3. What's the use case demonstrating performance improvement?

These require human input to answer before implementation can proceed.

## Reasoning

There's no actionable work ready to implement. The single task on the board needs clarification before it can move below the divider. According to the throttling rules, with open questions waiting for answers and no lower-priority work, the appropriate action is to sleep.
