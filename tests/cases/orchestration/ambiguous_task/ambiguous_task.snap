**Sync:**
The brief contains one new task: "Add a caching layer to the application." The board is empty, so I'll add this as a P1 entry below the divider.

**Pick:**
One P1 task is ready below the divider: "Add a caching layer to the application". No items are blocked above the divider, so this is actionable. Picking it now.

I'll start by reading the board and understanding the caching task.

I need to understand the caching requirements better before implementing. Let me post to the board with some clarifying questions.

Now let me commit and transition to dispatch for your input on these questions.

Reading the files now to sync and pick a task.

The brief contains the same task already on the board. The board entry for "P1: Add a caching layer to the application" is above the divider with open questions, meaning it's blocked on human input:
- What type of caching to use?
- Where's the actual bottleneck?
- What cache size/eviction policy?
- Should cache persist between runs?

**Analysis:**
- No new items in brief to add
- One P1 issue blocked above the divider
- Nothing actionable below the divider

No unblocked work is available. The caching task is waiting for decisions from the human.

**Reasoning:** All work is blocked on human input. Per throttling rules, I should sleep when there's nothing actionable.

<next>
sleep: true
</next>
