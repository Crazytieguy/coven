**Sync complete.** One new task from brief: "Add a caching layer to the application".

I'll start by reading the board and understanding the current state of the project.

I've reviewed the project and found an ambiguous situation. Let me update the board with my findings:

[24] ▶ Edit  (+16)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/...
[25] Thinking...
Now I'll commit this update and land it:

[27] Thinking...
[28] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[29] Thinking...
I've identified ambiguities in the caching task and posted them to the board. The application is currently a very simple text processor, and it's unclear what specific performance concern or caching strategy is needed. I've asked clarifying questions on the board and committed the update.

**Sync:** The brief item matches the P1 entry already on the board. No new work to add.

**Current state:** One issue (P1) is above the divider, blocked on human questions about the performance bottleneck and preferred caching approach. No actionable work below the divider.

**Decision:** Sleep. The blocked issue needs human input before any work can proceed.

sleep: true
