Now let me create a plan by updating the board.md with my analysis:

Perfect! I've planned the caching layer issue and moved it to **# Blocked** pending human decisions.

**Summary of my plan:**

The current application is very simple (just a `.upper()` function), so before implementing caching, I've identified key questions that need clarification:

1. **What is the actual bottleneck?** The process function is trivial — are we expecting repeated identical inputs, or is performance an issue elsewhere?
2. **Cache scope:** In-memory per-process, persistent across runs, or distributed?
3. **Caching approach:** Should we use `functools.lru_cache`, a simple dict, Redis, or something else?
4. **Cache invalidation:** Do we need TTL, size limits, or manual clearing?

These decisions will shape the entire implementation, so I've held off until you can clarify them.

The brief restates the caching layer task that's already on the board under `# Blocked`. No answers to the clarifying questions have been provided yet. Since the issue has unanswered questions, there's nothing actionable.
