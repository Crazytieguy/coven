I'll read the brief and board to understand the current state and sync new work.

I'll now sync the brief into the board. The brief has one task that needs to be added.

[8] Thinking...
I've synced the brief into the board. There's one P1 task: "Add a caching layer to the application."

However, this task has open questions that need clarification before we can proceed with implementation:
- What caching strategy should be used (in-memory, Redis, database query caching)?
- Which parts of the application should be cached?
- What cache invalidation strategy is needed?

<wait-for-user>
The caching layer task requires clarification on the strategy and scope before implementation can begin. Please provide guidance on:
1. What type of caching approach is preferred?
2. Which components or data should be cached?
3. How should cache invalidation be handled?
