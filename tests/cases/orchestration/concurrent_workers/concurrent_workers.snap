I found 2 approved issues, both P1 priority and ready for implementation. The review/ directory is empty, so there's no backlog of plans awaiting human review. 

I'll dispatch the simpler issue first—fixing the typo in the README—since it's a straightforward text-only change that can be completed quickly.

<dispatch>
agent: implement
issue: issues/fix-typo.md

I'll implement the plan from the issue file. Let me start by reading it.

[10] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

Now let me read the README.md file to find the typo:

[14] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[15] Thinking...
Now let me delete the issue file and commit the changes:

[21] Thinking...
Great! I've successfully implemented the plan:

1. ✅ Fixed the typo in README.md (changed "Helo" to "Hello")
2. ✅ Deleted the issue file
3. ✅ Committed the changes

The commit `e2e5fec` includes the typo fix and issue file deletion. The implementation is complete!

I'll check the current issue queue to determine what work to dispatch.

[23] ▶ Bash  head -7 issues/*.md review/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
[24] Thinking...
[25] ▶ Bash  head -7 issues/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
[26] Thinking...
[27] ▶ Bash  ls -la issues/ review/ 2>/dev/null | grep -E "\.md$"
[28] Thinking...
**Analysis:**

The issue queue contains:
- `issues/add-contributing.md` - state: `approved`, priority: `P1`

**Decision:**

The only approved issue (`add-contributing.md`) is currently being implemented by `cosmic-cedar-47`. There are no new issues to plan, no items in review, and no other work available.

Per the dispatch preferences: "Don't assign work another worker is already doing" and "If nothing is plannable or implementable, sleep."

<dispatch>
sleep: true
</dispatch>

## Analysis

I have two approved issues ready for implementation:

1. **fix-typo.md** (P1, approved) — Already being worked on by cool-spark-84 (PID 31981)
2. **add-contributing.md** (P1, approved) — Not assigned to any worker

Since cool-spark-84 is already handling the typo fix, I should assign the CONTRIBUTING.md task to this worker.

agent: implement
issue: issues/add-contributing.md

[9] Thinking...
I'll start by reading the issue file to understand the plan and what needs to be implemented.

[10] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

Now I'll create the CONTRIBUTING.md file with a brief "how to contribute" section:

[18] ▶ Write  (24 lines)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w000...
[19] Thinking...
Perfect! Now I'll delete the issue file and commit the changes:

[20] ▶ Bash  rm issues/add-contributing.md
[21] Thinking...
[22] ▶ Bash  git add CONTRIBUTING.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[23] Thinking...
Done! I've successfully implemented the plan:

✅ **Created CONTRIBUTING.md** with a brief "how to contribute" section that includes:
- Getting started instructions (fork, clone, create branch)
- Making changes workflow (commit, push, pull request)
- Guidelines for contributions

✅ **Deleted the issue file** (`issues/add-contributing.md`)

✅ **Committed the changes** with a descriptive commit message

The CONTRIBUTING.md file is now part of the repository and provides clear guidance for contributors.

1. Added CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines

[39] Thinking...
**Reasoning:**

The repository has no active issues:
- `issues/` directory does not exist
- `review/` directory is empty (only contains .gitkeep)

There are no issues in `new`, `approved`, `changes-requested`, or `needs-replan` states that would route to either the `plan` or `implement` agents. According to the dispatch preferences, when nothing is plannable or implementable, the worker should sleep.

<dispatch>
sleep: true
