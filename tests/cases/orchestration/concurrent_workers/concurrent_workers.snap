I'll check the current state of issues and the worktree to decide what work to pick up.

[2] ▶ Bash  head -7 issues/*.md review/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
[3] ▶ Bash  git status --short && git log --oneline main..HEAD 2>/dev/null | ...
[4] Thinking...
I found two approved P1 issues ready for implementation:
1. `issues/add-contributing.md` - Create CONTRIBUTING.md
2. `issues/fix-typo.md` - Fix README typo

The worktree is clean with no uncommitted changes. Both issues are in `approved` state and ready for implementation. I'll route to the implement agent to start with the first issue.

I'll help you implement the plan in the issue. Let me start by reading the issue file.

Now let me check if CONTRIBUTING.md already exists:

    ✗ Error: File does not exist.
[9] Thinking...
Let me check the project structure to understand what we're working with:

Now I'll create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with a clear "how to contribute" section:

[16] ▶ Write  (27 lines)  /tmp/coven-vcr-concurrent_workers-worker_a-worktree...
[17] Thinking...
Perfect! I've created the CONTRIBUTING.md file. Now let me verify it exists and then commit the changes:

[18] ▶ Read  /tmp/coven-vcr-concurrent_workers-worker_a-worktrees/coven-vcr-c...
[19] Thinking...
Excellent! The CONTRIBUTING.md file is created. Now I'll delete the issue file and commit the changes:

[20] ▶ Bash  cd /tmp/coven-vcr-concurrent_workers-worker_a-worktrees/coven-vc...
[21] Thinking...
[22] ▶ Bash  git add issues/add-contributing.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[23] Thinking...
Perfect! I've successfully implemented the plan:

✅ **Created CONTRIBUTING.md** - Added a comprehensive guide with:
  - How to Contribute section with step-by-step instructions
  - Guidelines for contributors
  - Getting Started guide

✅ **Deleted the issue file** - Removed `issues/add-contributing.md`

✅ **Committed the changes** - Created a clear commit message documenting the changes

The implementation is complete and ready for landing. Handing off to the land agent.

I'll help you land the changes on main. Let me start by reviewing the commits and diff on this branch.

[25] ▶ Bash  git log --oneline main..HEAD
[26] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
     ✗ Error: Exit code 128

Let me check the current git state and available branches:

[28] ▶ Bash  git branch -a
[29] ▶ Bash  git log --oneline -10
[30] Thinking...
[31] ▶ Bash  git log --oneline master..HEAD
[32] ▶ Bash  git diff master...HEAD
[33] Thinking...
Perfect! I can see there's one commit to land:
- **eab0bc1**: Create CONTRIBUTING.md

The changes show:
- A new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with contribution guidelines
- The tracking issue file `issues/add-contributing.md` has been deleted

This looks good. Now let me run the landing script to rebase and fast-forward the changes onto master:

[34] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[35] Thinking...
Excellent! The landing was successful. The changes have been rebased and fast-forwarded onto master:

✓ 1 commit landed successfully
✓ CONTRIBUTING.md created with contribution guidelines
✓ Tracking issue removed

The branch is now fully landed on master. Handing off to the dispatch agent to pick up the next task.

## Analysis

**Worktree state:** Clean, on branch `crisp-bear-99`, not ahead of master

**Available issues:**
- `issues/fix-typo.md` (P1, `approved`) — Ready to implement

**Decision:** The only available issue is already being worked on by the `clear-raven-19` worker (currently running land). Following the dispatch preference "Don't assign work another worker is already doing," there is no new work to pick up.

I'll check the current state of issues and the worktree to determine the best next task.

[2] ▶ Bash  head -7 issues/*.md review/*.md 2>/dev/null || true
[3] ▶ Bash  git status
[4] ▶ Bash  git log --oneline -5
[5] Thinking...
**Current Status:**
- Worktree is clean, not ahead of main
- Two approved issues ready for implementation
- `crisp-bear-99` is already working on `add-contributing.md`

**Routing Decision:**
I'll implement `fix-typo.md` (P1, approved). This avoids conflicts with the other worker while keeping this worker productive on high-priority work.

Excellent! The changes have been successfully landed on master. The landing script rebased 2 commits:

Both commits are now fast-forwarded to master.
