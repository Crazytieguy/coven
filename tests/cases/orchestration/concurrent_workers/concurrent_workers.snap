**Sync complete.** Added both brief items to the board:
- P1: Fix the typo in README.md (Helo → Hello)
- P1: Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file

Both tasks are ready below the divider with no open questions. I'll pick the typo fix first since it's the simplest task.

I'll start by reading the board and scratch files to understand the task.

Now let me explore the repository structure to understand what I'm working with.

[53] ▶ Bash  find . -type f -name "*.md" | head -20
[54] ▶ Bash  ls -la
[55] Thinking...
Let me read the README and brief to understand what this project is about:

I'll create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with a brief "how to contribute" section:

[59] ▶ Write  (15 lines)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w000...
[60] Thinking...
Now let me verify the file was created correctly and commit the changes:

[62] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[63] Thinking...
Let me commit this change:

[64] ▶ Bash  git add CONTRIBUTING.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[65] ▶ Bash  git status
[66] Thinking...
Now let me update the board.md to move the completed task to the Done section:

[67] ▶ Edit  (-3)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/c...

Let me verify the work is complete:

[74] Thinking...
Perfect! I've successfully completed the task:

✅ **Created CONTRIBUTING.md** with a "how to contribute" section that includes:
- Instructions for forking, branching, and submitting PRs

## Sync Complete

I've synced both tasks from the brief onto the board:
- **P1: Fix the typo in README.md** — Change "Helo" to "Hello"
- **P1: Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file** — Add a brief "how to contribute" section

Both tasks are ready to implement (below the divider). No open questions exist on the board, so there's no throttling. Picking the first P1 task.

I'll start by reading the board and scratch files to understand the current state of this task.

[22] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

[24] Thinking...
Now let me read the README.md to find the typo:

[25] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[26] Thinking...
Found it! Let me fix the typo:

Now let me create the scratch.md file to document progress:

[31] ▶ Write  (11 lines)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w000...
[32] Thinking...
Perfect! The typo is fixed. Since this is a straightforward one-line change, let me proceed with the review session now. First, let me check the diff:

[33] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[34] Thinking...
Excellent! The diff shows the correct change. The task is complete - the typo "Helo" has been changed to "Hello". Now let me update the board to move this to Done:

[35] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[36] Thinking...
Now commit the board update:

[37] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[38] Thinking...
Now let me land the changes:

[39] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
     ✗ Error: Exit code 1
[40] Thinking...
There's a conflict in board.md. Let me check what it looks like:

[41] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[42] Thinking...
Let me resolve the conflict. Since the task entry has already been removed from main (by another worker), I'll keep the resolution that has the Done section:

[43] ▶ Edit  (-12)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/...
[44] Thinking...
Now continue the rebase:

[45] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git rebase --continue
[46] Thinking...
Now run land.sh again:

[47] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
     ✗ Error: Exit code 1
[48] Thinking...
Let me check what the board looks like on main:

[49] ▶ Bash  git show main:board.md
[50] Thinking...
I see - main already has both tasks in Done. Let me resolve the conflict to match main:

[51] ▶ Edit  (-14)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/...
[52] Thinking...
Continue the rebase:

[53] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git rebase --continue
[54] Thinking...
Now run land.sh to complete the landing:

[55] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[56] Thinking...
Perfect! Now let me clean up by deleting scratch.md:

[57] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md
[58] Thinking...
Done! I've successfully fixed the typo in README.md ("Helo" → "Hello"), committed the change, resolved board conflicts with another worker's changes, and landed the work. Now transitioning to dispatch for the next task.
