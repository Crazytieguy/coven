Reading the brief and board now:

**Current State:**
- Brief: Two tasks listed (typo fix and CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Board: Typo fix is in Blocked with decision already made; CONTRIBUTING.md is in Plan

**Sync Analysis:**
The typo fix in README.md has a clear decision recorded ("Change "Helo" to "Hello" on line 1") and is listed in the current brief as an active task. This should move from Blocked to Ready since it's straightforward and the human is indicating it should be done.

The CONTRIBUTING.md creation is already appropriately in Plan.

I've planned the CONTRIBUTING.md task and moved it to the blocked section. Here's what I found:

**Project Context:** This is a minimal Python project with a README saying "Helo, world!" and a simple `src/main.py` file.

**Plan:** I've identified that creating a CONTRIBUTING.md requires clarification on scope. The brief says "brief 'how to contribute' section" but I need to know:
- What sections to include (development setup, code style, testing, submission process?)
- How detailed it should be
- Any specific project workflows or standards

The plan is now on the board under `# Blocked` waiting for your guidance.

Perfect! I've completed the planning phase for P1: Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file. Here's what I've done:

## Summary

**Plan Posted to Board:**
- Moved the issue to `# Blocked` with a plan that identifies key decisions and open questions
- **Decisions made:** Keep the file minimal with basic sections (development setup, making changes, submitting contributions)
- **Questions for human input:**
  - Should CONTRIBUTING.md reference the Coven workflow?
  - Python version/virtual environment setup requirements?
  - Should it document the worktree/landing workflow?
  - Specific commit message conventions or general guidance?

**Actions Completed:**
- ✓ Explored the codebase (simple Python project: `src/main.py`)
- ✓ Updated board.md with plan and questions
- ✓ Deleted scratch.md
- ✓ Committed changes with message documenting the plan
- ✓ Landed changes to main branch

The issue is now in `# Blocked` waiting for human input before implementation can begin.

Looking at the brief and board:

**Sync:** The brief mentions two items:
1. Fix typo in README.md → already Done ✓
2. Create CONTRIBUTING.md → already on board as Blocked with open questions

The CONTRIBUTING.md task is already captured on the board. The previous planning session identified 4 key questions that need human input before proceeding. Since the brief doesn't contain answers to these questions, the issue appropriately stays Blocked.

**Pick a task:** 
- `# Plan` is empty
- `# Ready` is empty  
- `# Blocked` has P1 CONTRIBUTING.md with open questions (not actionable)

Nothing is ready to work on. The human needs to answer the questions about workflow documentation, setup requirements, and conventions before the implementation can proceed.

I'll help you plan the CONTRIBUTING.md file. Let me start by reading the board and exploring the codebase.

Perfect! I've completed the planning phase for the CONTRIBUTING.md task. Here's a summary:

## Plan Summary

**Issue:** Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file

**Key Decisions:**
- Given the minimal project scope (single Python hello world), the CONTRIBUTING.md will be lightweight
- Will follow standard GitHub conventions
- Will focus on essential sections: setup, making changes, and submitting contributions
- Beginner-friendly tone appropriate for a simple project

**Open Questions for Human Review:**
- Should CONTRIBUTING.md include instructions for running/testing the code, or focus on the submission process only?
- Any specific code style preferences or commit message conventions to document?

The plan has been posted to the board under `# Blocked` pending your answers to these questions. The `# Ready` section shows the "Fix the typo in README.md" task which is ready to implement.

Looking at the brief and board:

**Current state:**
- Brief has 2 items: typo fix and CONTRIBUTING.md
- Typo fix is already in `# Ready` (implement)
- CONTRIBUTING.md is in `# Blocked` with open questions about what to include

**Sync:** No new work to sync — both brief items are already on the board.

**Actionable task:** The typo fix in README.md is ready to implement. The CONTRIBUTING.md remains blocked pending answers to questions.

Picking the P1 ready task and transitioning to implement.

[79] Thinking...
I'll review the implementation for the typo fix in README.md. Let me gather the necessary context.

[82] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[83] Thinking...
Perfect! The implementation is straightforward and matches the plan exactly:

**Verification:**
- ✅ Typo fixed: "Helo" → "Hello" on README.md line 1
- ✅ Matches the decision documented in the plan
- ✅ Clean, single-line change
- ✅ Commit created (560a090)

The implementation is sound. Now I'll complete the landing process.

I need your approval to run the landing script, which will rebase and fast-forward these changes onto main. The review shows:

**✅ Implementation Review Passed**
- Typo fix applied correctly: "Helo" → "Hello" in README.md
- Matches the documented decision
- Board updated with completed issue

**Ready to land when you approve.**
