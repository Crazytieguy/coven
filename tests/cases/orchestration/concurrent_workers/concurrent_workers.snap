I've completed the task: fixed the typo in README.md (changed "Helo" to "Hello"), committed the change, and updated the board. Now I need to land the changes using the standard orchestration script. 

The `bash .coven/land.sh` command requires approval. This is the standard way to land commits to main in this orchestration system. Could you approve running this command?

I'll help you work on creating CONTRIBUTING.md. Let me start by reading the board and relevant context files.
