I found 2 approved issues ready for implementation, both at P1 priority:

1. **fix-typo.md** (approved, P1) - Change "Helo" to "Hello" in README.md
2. **add-contributing.md** (approved, P1) - Create CONTRIBUTING.md file

No issues in review, and no new/planning issues. I'll dispatch the simpler typo fix first.

agent: implement
issue: issues/fix-typo.md

I'll help you implement the plan in the issue file. Let me start by reading the issue to understand what needs to be done.

[10] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

Now let me read the README.md file to find and fix the typo.

[12] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

Found the typo! Let me fix it.

[14] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[15] Thinking...
Perfect! Now let me delete the issue file and commit the changes.

[16] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[17] Thinking...

✅ **Implementation complete!**

I've successfully:
1. Fixed the typo in README.md: changed "Helo, world!" to "Hello, world!"
2. Deleted the issue file
3. Committed the changes

The simple text-only change is done and committed.

**Analysis:**

I found one issue in the queue:
- `issues/add-contributing.md` - state: `approved`, priority: `P1`

This is an approved issue that should be routed to the `implement` agent. However, according to the current worker status, `fleet-ember-16` is already running `implement` on this exact issue (`issues/add-contributing.md`).

Per the dispatch preferences, I should not assign work that another worker is already doing. There are no other plannable or implementable issues available.

<dispatch>
sleep: true
</dispatch>

I'll check the current issue queue to determine what work needs to be done next.

[2] ▶ Bash  head -7 issues/*.md review/*.md 2>/dev/null || true

**Analysis:**

- `issues/fix-typo.md`: P1, approved → already assigned to bright-bear-99
- `issues/add-contributing.md`: P1, approved → available for implementation
- `review/`: empty, no plans pending review
- No new or changes-requested issues

**Decision:**

Implement `add-contributing.md` since it's an approved P1 issue that's not currently being worked on. This avoids conflicts with the other worker and keeps momentum on the approved backlog.

<dispatch>
agent: implement
issue: issues/add-contributing.md

I'll help you implement the plan from the issue file. Let me start by reading the issue to understand what needs to be done.

Now let me check if CONTRIBUTING.md already exists:

[11] ▶ Glob  CONTRIBUTING.md
[12] Thinking...
Let me check the project structure to create an appropriate CONTRIBUTING.md:

[13] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

[20] Thinking...
Perfect! Now I'll delete the issue file and commit the changes:

[23] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[24] Thinking...
Done! I've successfully implemented the plan:

✅ Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with a comprehensive "how to contribute" section that includes:
- Instructions for forking and cloning the repository
- Guidance on creating issues before implementing changes
- Branch creation workflow
- Commit and pull request best practices
- Reference to the coven development workflow
- Code standards guidelines
- A welcoming closing note

✅ Deleted the issue file (`issues/add-contributing.md`)

✅ Committed the changes with a descriptive message

The CONTRIBUTING.md file is now ready to help future contributors understand how to participate in the project!

**Reasoning:**

The `issues/` directory doesn't exist and the `review/` directory is empty. There are no issues in any state (`new`, `approved`, `changes-requested`, or `needs-replan`) available for planning or implementation.

According to the dispatch preferences, when nothing is plannable or implementable, the worker should sleep.
