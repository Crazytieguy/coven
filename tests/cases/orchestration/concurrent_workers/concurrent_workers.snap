1. P1: Fix typo in README.md
2. P1: Create CONTRIBUTING.md file

Both tasks are straightforward with clear paths forward. Picking the simpler one first.

## Review Summary

Looking at this implementation, I need to understand the current state:

**Implementation Work:**
- The typo fix in README.md is correct (changed "Helo" to "Hello" in commit a831d8b)
- The fix is complete and matches the acceptance criteria

**Board Management Issue:**
The board.md has a problem: it contains duplicate entries with the tasks in BOTH "Plan" and "Ready" sections. The current branch is based on an older state before commit `aee6058` which was supposed to clean this up. This isn't the implementer's fault—it's a pre-existing state on this branch.

**Decision: Land with cleanup**

The implementation is correct. I'll clean up the board by:
1. Removing the duplicate entries from "Plan"
2. Moving "Fix typo in README.md" to "Done"
3. Keeping "Create CONTRIBUTING.md file" in "Ready" (that's a separate task)

Let me make these changes:

[101] ▶ Edit  (-10)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T...
[102] Thinking...
Now I'll commit the board cleanup and delete scratch.md:

[103] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md && git add -A && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[104] Thinking...
Now I'll land the changes:

[105] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[106] Thinking...
Review complete. The implementation is sound—the typo fix is correct and properly committed. I've cleaned up the board by:
- Removing duplicate entries from the Plan section
- Moving the completed task to Done
- Keeping the CONTRIBUTING.md task in Ready for the next implementer

The changes have been landed successfully.

Looking at the brief and board:

**Brief items:** Two straightforward tasks (fix typo, create CONTRIBUTING.md)
**Board status:** Both tasks are already completed and in the `# Done` section

The brief doesn't contain any new work—both items have already been addressed. There are no tasks in `# Plan`, `# Ready`, or `# Blocked` sections.

Since there's no actionable work, I'll sleep.

- Fast-forward main to include the new commits
