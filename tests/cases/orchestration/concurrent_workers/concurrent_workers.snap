Perfect! I've completed the task:

✓ Created CONTRIBUTING.md with a brief "how to contribute" section
✓ The CONTRIBUTING.md file was already created on main by another worker (bright-canyon-87), so I resolved the merge conflict and kept that version
✓ Updated board.md to mark the task as complete
✓ Landed the changes on main

The CONTRIBUTING.md now includes sections for:
- Getting Started (forking, cloning, branching)
- Making Changes (testing and commit practices)
- Submitting Changes (PR workflow)
- Questions (encouragement to open issues)
