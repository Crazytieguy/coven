**Board synced.** I've added both tasks from the brief as P1 items below the divider—both are ready to implement with no open questions.

**Picking task:** "Fix the typo in README.md" (first P1 task). It's a straightforward text-only change, making it a good first task to complete.

I'll sync the board. I can see:

**Current state:**
- The typo fix task is already done (in Done section)
- The CONTRIBUTING.md task appears twice - once above and once below the divider
- The board has inconsistencies that need cleanup

**Sync needed:**
- Remove the duplicate "Fix the typo" entry from above the divider (it's already in Done)
- Keep only one entry for "Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file" below the divider (it's not yet done)

## Sync Complete

I've synced both items from the brief onto the board as P1 entries, committed the changes, and landed them to main.

**Reasoning for task selection:**
- 2 P1 tasks are ready below the divider
- No open questions above the divider
- Picking the first P1 by order: "Fix the typo in README.md" (simple, text-only change)

Looking at the brief and board:

**Sync Analysis:**
- ✓ "Fix the typo in README.md" is completed and already in Done
- ✓ "Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file" is already on the board as P1

The board is already in sync with the brief. No new work to add.

**Task Selection:**
There are no open questions blocking work. The only actionable item below the divider is:
- **P1: Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file** — ready to implement

This is the highest priority available work with no blockers.

2. Committed the file: `Create CONTRIBUTING.md with how to contribute section`
3. Moved the board entry to Done and committed that change

**Next step:** I need to run `bash .coven/land.sh` to finalize the changes and land them to the main branch. This requires your approval to execute the bash command.
