## Status

**Brief vs Board:** The brief and board are in sync. The typo fix task is complete and already in Done. The CONTRIBUTING.md task is on the board ready to work.

**No blocked issues** — can pick P1 work without throttling concerns.

## Pick

**Task: P1: Create CONTRIBUTING.md**

This is the only actionable item below the divider. Straightforward: create a new CONTRIBUTING.md file with brief contribution guidelines.

I've read both files. Here's what I found:

**Brief**: Two tasks
1. Fix typo in README.md ("Helo" → "Hello")
2. Create CONTRIBUTING.md file

**Board**: Both tasks are already in the Done section. The git log confirms:
- Commit 2ba2f18: Fix typo in README.md
- Commit da4eb70: Create CONTRIBUTING.md

The brief is fully aligned with the board — nothing new to sync. No pending work below the divider, no blocked items above it.

**Decision**: Sleep. All tasks are complete.
