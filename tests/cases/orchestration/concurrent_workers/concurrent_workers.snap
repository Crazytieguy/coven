## Summary

**Synced:** Added two P1 tasks from brief to board:
1. Fix typo in README.md ("Helo" → "Hello")
2. Create CONTRIBUTING.md file

**Reasoning:** No open questions on the board, so P1 work is actionable. I'll pick the typo fix first as it's straightforward.

I'll start by reading the board and scratch files to understand the current state of the task.

[15] Thinking...
Now let me read the README.md to find the typo that needs fixing:

[16] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[17] Thinking...
Found it! Let me fix the typo:

[18] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[19] Thinking...
Now let me create the scratch.md file to record progress:

[20] ▶ Write  (8 lines)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000...
[21] Thinking...
Now let me commit the change:

[22] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
[23] Thinking...
Let me review the change before moving it to Done:

[24] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[25] Thinking...
Perfect! The change is correct. Now let me update the board to move this issue to Done:

[26] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[27] Thinking...
Now let me commit the board update:

[28] ▶ Bash  git add board.md && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[29] Thinking...
Now let me run the land script:

[30] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[31] Thinking...
Perfect! Now let me delete the scratch file and transition to dispatch:

[32] ▶ Bash  rm scratch.md
[33] Thinking...
Done! The typo fix has been completed and landed on main. Moving to dispatch for the next task.

## Sync Analysis

**Brief vs Board:**
- Brief item 1 (Fix typo in README.md) → Already in Done ✓
- Brief item 2 (Create CONTRIBUTING.md file) → Already on board as P1 ✓

No new items to add. No Done cleanup requested. Board is already synced.

## Task Selection

**Open questions above divider:** None
**Actionable items below divider:** 1 (P1: Create CONTRIBUTING.md file)
**Throttling:** Not applicable (no blocking questions)

I'll pick the P1: Create CONTRIBUTING.md file task. It's the only actionable work and has no blockers.

[61] Thinking...
Perfect! I've successfully completed the task:

1. ✅ Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with a brief "how to contribute" section that includes:
   - A welcoming introduction
   - Step-by-step contribution steps (fork, feature branch, improvements, PR)
   - Contribution guidelines (commits, testing, code style)

2. ✅ Committed the changes
3. ✅ Moved the issue to Done in board.md
4. ✅ Landed the changes to main

The repository now has both the README and a CONTRIBUTING guide for new contributors.

Both brief items are already in the Done section of the board:

The board is fully synced. There are no open questions, and there are no actionable items below the divider. All work is complete.
