## Sync Complete

I've added both brief items to the board as P1 tasks below the divider. Both are ready to work on.

**Board status:**
- 2 actionable P1 tasks
- 0 open questions
- No throttling needed

**Picking task:** "Fix typo in README.md" — simpler task, good starting point.

**Sync check:** Both brief items are accounted for:
- "Fix the typo in README.md" → Done ✓
- "Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file" → P1 on board ✓

No new items to sync, no open questions.

**Task availability:** The only ready task (P1: Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file) is already in progress by worker `clever-drift-53`. No other actionable work available.

     ✗ Error: This command requires approval
[65] Thinking...
I've completed the implementation and review for the CONTRIBUTING.md file:

**✅ Completed:**
1. Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` with:
   - A welcoming introduction
   - Clear "How to Contribute" section with 5 steps (fork, branch, commit, push, PR)
   - "Guidelines" section with best practices
2. Committed both changes (CONTRIBUTING.md creation and board.md update)
3. Moved the task to Done in board.md

**Current Status:**
- 2 commits ready on branch `clever-drift-53`
- Awaiting execution of `.coven/land.sh` to merge to main
- `scratch.md` needs to be deleted after landing

The land script execution requires approval due to the shared nature of pushing to main. Once you approve the land operation, the task will be fully complete and I can transition to dispatch.
