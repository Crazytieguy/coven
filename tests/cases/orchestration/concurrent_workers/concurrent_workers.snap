## Analysis

**Issues:** No issues in `issues/` or `review/` directories — nothing to plan or implement.

**Worktree:** Clean, not ahead of main. No changes to land.

**Conclusion:** With no plannable or implementable work available, this worker should sleep and wait for new commits on main.

**Reasoning:**
- Worktree is clean and on branch fleet-oak-26
- No issues in `review/` waiting for human approval
- Two approved issues ready for implementation, both P1 priority
- No other workers active
- No planning needed — both issues already have plans written

I'll route to the implement agent to work on the first approved issue.

I'll review the current branch's changes and land them on main. Let me start by examining the commits and diff.

[26] ▶ Bash  git log --oneline main..HEAD
[27] ▶ Bash  git diff main...HEAD
[28] ▶ Bash  git status
[29] Thinking...
I see there's one commit to land and the working directory has an unstaged deletion. Let me clean up the working directory first by staging the deletion.

[30] ▶ Bash  git add issues/add-contributing.md && git status
[31] Thinking...
Now let me commit this cleanup before landing:

[32] ▶ Bash  git commit -m "Remove completed issue file"
[33] Thinking...
Now let me run the landing script to rebase and fast-forward merge to main:

[34] ▶ Bash  bash .coven/land.sh
[35] Thinking...
✓ Successfully landed changes on main. The branch has been rebased and merged, including:
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
- Removed the completed issue file

## Analysis

I found 1 issue in the queue:
- **fix-typo.md** (P1, approved) — Fix "Helo" to "Hello" in README.md

Since this issue has `state: approved`, it's ready for implementation. There are no issues in `new`, `changes-requested`, or `needs-replan` states awaiting planning, and no `review/` items. The worktree is clean.

## Decision

Route this approved issue to the implement agent to fix the typo.

I'll implement the plan in the issue file. Let me start by reading it to understand what needs to be done.

[44] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

Now let me read the README.md file to find and fix the typo.

[48] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
