I'll read the brief and board, sync the tasks, and pick work.

**Brief summary:** 2 tasks
1. Fix typo in README.md (Helo → Hello)
2. Create CONTRIBUTING.md file

**Board status:** Empty (just the divider)

Let me sync these tasks onto the board:

**Sync complete.** Both tasks from brief are now on board as P1 entries below the divider.

**Task selection:** Picking **P1: Fix the typo in README.md** — it's straightforward and unblocked.
