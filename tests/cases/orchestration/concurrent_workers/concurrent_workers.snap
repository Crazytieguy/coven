## Decision

I found 2 approved P1 issues ready for implementation:
1. **fix-typo.md** — Fix "Helo" → "Hello" in README.md
2. **add-contributing.md** — Create CONTRIBUTING.md file

No new issues to plan. Both approved issues are implementable. I'll route the simpler one (typo fix) to the implement agent first.

Done! I've successfully implemented the plan:

1. ✅ Fixed the typo in README.md: "Helo" → "Hello"
2. ✅ Deleted the issue file
3. ✅ Committed the changes with a descriptive message

The commit has been created with both the README change and the issue file deletion.

## Analysis

Looking at the current state:

**Issues found:**
- `issues/add-contributing.md` (P1, state: approved)

**Current situation:**
- The only approved issue (`add-contributing.md`) is already being implemented by another worker (steady-meteor-7 with PID 87644)
- No `new`, `changes-requested`, or `needs-replan` issues available to plan
- No items in `review/` awaiting human review

**Decision reasoning:**
According to dispatch preferences: "Don't assign work another worker is already doing" and "If nothing is plannable or implementable, sleep."

Since the only available work is already assigned to another worker and there are no new issues to plan, this worker should sleep.

<dispatch>
sleep: true
</dispatch>

I can see the current issue queue:

1. **add-contributing.md** — `P1`, `approved` — Create CONTRIBUTING.md file
2. **fix-typo.md** — `P1`, `approved` — Fix README typo

The warm-pulse-52 worker is already implementing `fix-typo.md`, so I'll assign the other approved issue to this worker to avoid conflicts.

Done! I've successfully implemented the plan:

✅ **Created CONTRIBUTING.md** with a brief "how to contribute" section including:
- Getting Started instructions
- Making Changes guidelines
- Submitting Changes process
- Reporting Issues instructions

✅ **Deleted the issue file** and committed the changes with a descriptive message

The implementation is complete.
