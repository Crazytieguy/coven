## Analysis

I found 2 issues in the `issues/` directory, both with `state: approved`:

1. **fix-typo.md** (P1) — Fix README typo: change "Helo" to "Hello"
2. **add-contributing.md** (P1) — Create CONTRIBUTING.md file

Both are ready for implementation. Since there are no `new` issues to plan and no active workers, I'll dispatch the simpler task (fix-typo) first.

<dispatch>
agent: implement
issue: issues/fix-typo.md
</dispatch>

I'll help you implement the plan in the issue file. Let me start by reading the issue to understand what needs to be done.

[10] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[11] Thinking...
Now let me read the README.md file to find and fix the typo.

[12] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...

Found the typo! Let me fix it.

[14] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[15] Thinking...
Perfect! Now let me delete the issue file and commit the changes.

[17] Thinking...
Done! I've successfully implemented the plan:

1. ✅ Found and fixed the typo in README.md: "Helo" → "Hello"
2. ✅ Deleted the issue file
3. ✅ Committed the changes with a descriptive message

Let me check the git status to see what changes are uncommitted.

[19] ▶ Bash  git status
[20] Thinking...
I see the issue - the file deletion needs to be staged. Let me fix that.

[21] ▶ Bash  git add -u && git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

[23] ▶ Bash  git status
[24] Thinking...
Perfect! All changes are now committed. The implementation is complete:

- ✅ Fixed typo in README.md (Helo → Hello)
- ✅ Deleted the issue file
- ✅ All changes committed with proper messages
- ✅ Working directory clean

I'll check the current state of issues and decide what to dispatch next.

[31] Thinking...
**Current State:**
- One issue exists: `issues/add-contributing.md` (P1, approved)
- Another worker (eager-ember-35) is already implementing this issue

**Decision:**
There are no actionable issues available since the only approved issue is already being worked on by another worker. According to the dispatch preferences, I should sleep.

<dispatch>
sleep: true
</dispatch>

**Current Issues:**
- `add-contributing.md` (P1, approved) — Create CONTRIBUTING.md file
- `fix-typo.md` (P1, approved) — cosmic-otter-5 is already implementing this

**Reasoning:**
The `fix-typo.md` issue is already being worked on by cosmic-otter-5. The `add-contributing.md` issue is also approved and ready to implement, and no worker is currently assigned to it. I'll dispatch this worker to implement it.

Perfect! I've successfully completed the implementation:

✅ **Created CONTRIBUTING.md** with:
- How to report issues (referencing the coven workflow)
- Code change guidelines following the project's orchestrated workflow
- Development setup instructions
- Project workflow explanation
- Code quality standards

✅ **Cleaned up**:
- Deleted the issue file (`issues/add-contributing.md`)
- Committed all changes with a descriptive message

The CONTRIBUTING.md file provides clear guidance for potential contributors on how to participate in this coven-based project while respecting the orchestrated development workflow.

**Reasoning:** 

I checked the issue queue and found:
- No `issues/` directory exists
- The `review/` directory is empty (only contains `.gitkeep`)

This means there are no issues to plan or implement. Following the dispatch instructions, when nothing is plannable or implementable, the worker should sleep.

<dispatch>
sleep: true
