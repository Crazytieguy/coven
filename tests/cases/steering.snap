[1] Thinking...
I'll help you read and summarize each Python file in this directory. Let me start by finding all .py files.

> A⤷ steering: Actually, just count the lines in each file instead
[2] ▶ Glob  *.py
[3] Thinking...
Got it! I'll count the lines in each file instead. Let me do that for you:

[4] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...
[5] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...
[6] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...
[7] Thinking...
Here are the line counts for each Python file:

1. **counter.py**: 4 lines
2. **greet.py**: 3 lines
3. **hello.py**: 2 lines
