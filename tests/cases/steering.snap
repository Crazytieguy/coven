[1] Thinking...
I'll help you read and summarize the Python files in this directory. Let me start by finding all .py files.

> A⤷ steering: Actually, just count the lines in each file instead
[2] ▶ Glob  *.py
[3] Thinking...
Got it! I'll count the lines in each file instead. Let me do that for the three Python files found:

[4] ▶ Bash  wc -l /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/co...
[5] Thinking...
Here are the line counts for each Python file:

- **hello.py**: 2 lines
- **counter.py**: 4 lines
- **greet.py**: 3 lines
- **Total**: 9 lines
