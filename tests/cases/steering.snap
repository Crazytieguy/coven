Session 3c22b91b-7f30-4e66-a285-fd110b6e76b1 (claude-opus-4-6)

[1] Thinking...
Let me start by finding all the `.py` files in this directory.

[2] ▶ Glob  **/*.py
Found 3 `.py` files. Let me read the first one.

[3] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-steering/greet.py
**`greet.py`** — A simple greeting script. It takes an optional command-line argument for a name (defaulting to `'World'`) and prints `Hello, {name}!`. 3 lines of code.

Now the second file.

[4] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-steering/hello.py
**`hello.py`** — A minimal script that prints `hello world` followed by `goodbye`. 2 lines of code.

Now the third file.

[5] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-steering/counter.py
**`counter.py`** — Sums the integers 0 through 9 using a loop and prints the total (which is 45). 4 lines of code.

I also saw your follow-up asking to just count lines instead. Here's the summary:

| File | Lines |
|---|---|
| `greet.py` | 3 |
| `hello.py` | 2 |
| `counter.py` | 4 |
