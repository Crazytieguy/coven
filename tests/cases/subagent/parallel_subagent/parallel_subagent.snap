## Summary

I've successfully spawned two subagents in parallel to read the files. Here's what they found:

**README.md:**
- Describes a "Test Project" - a minimal project created specifically for testing parallel subagent display in coven
- Contains only a title and a single line description
- This is a test/demo project, not production code

**notes.txt:**
- Contains a single line: "These are test notes for the parallel subagent test case."
- Serves as placeholder/test data for validating parallel subagent functionality
- Minimal content intended for testing purposes

Both files are test fixtures for evaluating the parallel subagent execution feature.
