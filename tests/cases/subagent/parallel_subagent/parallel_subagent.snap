## Summary

**README.md:**
The project is titled "Test Project" and is described as a minimal project for testing parallel subagent display functionality in a tool/system called "coven".

**notes.txt:**
Contains a single line of test notes indicating this is a parallel subagent test case.

Both files are minimal and appear to be part of a test setup for validating parallel subagent execution in the coven system.
