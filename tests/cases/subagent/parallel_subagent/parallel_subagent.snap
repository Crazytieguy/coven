## Summary

I've successfully spawned two subagents in parallel to read both files. Here are the results:

**README.md:**
- Contains a project header titled "Test Project"
- Describes it as a minimal project for testing parallel subagent display in coven

**notes.txt:**
- Contains test notes for the parallel subagent test case

Both files appear to be simple test fixtures for this parallel subagent testing scenario.
