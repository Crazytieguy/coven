## Summary

Both files were successfully read:

**README.md**: Contains a brief project description. It's titled "Test Project" and describes itself as "a minimal project for testing parallel subagent display in coven."

**notes.txt**: Contains a single line of test notes stating: "These are test notes for the parallel subagent test case."

Both files are minimal, as expected for a test project setup.
