## Summary

I've successfully spawned two subagents in parallel to read both files. Here are the results:

**README.md:**
- Project name: "Test Project"
- Purpose: A minimal project designed for testing parallel subagent display in coven (a testing framework/tool)
- The file is quite brief with limited additional details about structure or dependencies

**notes.txt:**
- Contains a single line of documentation
- States these are test notes created for the parallel subagent test case
- Appears to be a placeholder/marker file used for testing purposes

Both files are part of a test setup for the parallel subagent functionality in coven.
