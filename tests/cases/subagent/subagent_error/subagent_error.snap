[3] Thinking...
Done! The subagent successfully read both files in parallel:

- **README.md**: Contains "# Test Project" heading and "A minimal project for testing."
- **nonexistent.txt**: File doesn't exist (returned error as expected)

Both Read calls were executed simultaneously in a single message.
