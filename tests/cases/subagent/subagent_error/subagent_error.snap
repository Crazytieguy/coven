  [2/1] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
  [2/2] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/cove...
        ✗ File does not exist.
[3] Thinking...
Done! The subagent successfully read both files in parallel. Here's what it found:

- **README.md**: Exists and contains "# Test Project" with the description "A minimal project for testing."
- **nonexistent.txt**: Does not exist in the current directory, so the read returned an error.

The parallel Read calls were made simultaneously in the same function call block as requested.
