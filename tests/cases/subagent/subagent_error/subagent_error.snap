[3] Thinking...
Done! The subagent successfully made parallel Read calls to both files:
- **README.md** was read successfully (contains "# Test Project" and description text)
- **nonexistent.txt** returned an error as expected (file doesn't exist)

Both Read calls were executed simultaneously in a single function_calls block.
