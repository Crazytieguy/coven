[1] Thinking...
I'll check the TODO.md file for unchecked tasks.

[2] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...
[3] Thinking...
I found 2 unchecked tasks. Let me do the first one: create a hello.py that prints 'hi'.

[4] ▶ Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn...
[5] Thinking...
Now I'll mark the first task as done in TODO.md.

[6] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...
[7] Thinking...
Completed the first task! Created hello.py with `print('hi')`. Now marking the next task for the next iteration.
