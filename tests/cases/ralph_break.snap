Let me start by reading the TODO.md file.

[1] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-ralph_break/TODO.md
The first unchecked task is to create `hello.py` that prints 'hi'. Let me do that and then mark it done.

[2] ▶ Write  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-ralph_break/hello.py (1 lines)
[3] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vcr-ralph_break/TODO.md
Done. Created `hello.py` that prints `'hi'` and marked the task complete in TODO.md.
