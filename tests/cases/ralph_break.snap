[3] Thinking...
I found two unchecked tasks. Let me work on the first one: create a hello.py that prints 'hi'.

[4] ▶ Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn...
[5] Thinking...
Now let me mark that task as done:

[6] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-vc...
[7] Thinking...
Now let me work on the second task. First, let me check if there's any context about the project name:

[8] ▶ Bash  cd /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven...
[9] Thinking...
Let me check what's already in the directory:

[10] ▶ Bash  ls -la
[11] Thinking...
Now I'll create a README.md with the project name. Based on the directory structure, I'll use "coven-vcr" as the project name:

[12] ▶ Write  (1 line)  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000g...
[13] Thinking...
Now let me mark the second task as done:

[14] ▶ Edit  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[15] Thinking...
Let me verify that all tasks are now complete:

[16] ▶ Read  /private/var/folders/21/3gpj27c974j5vc436plct78w0000gn/T/coven-v...
[17] Thinking...
